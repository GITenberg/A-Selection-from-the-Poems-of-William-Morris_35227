<p>Franz Hueffer who came into the Rossetti circle in the manner indicated
in the following letter (of which the greater part is in the writing of
the late Lucy Rossetti - daughter of Ford Madox Brown) was a
broad-headed, plodding, able German who wrote and spoke English
perfectly enough before his naturalization. He was somewhat heavy in his
enthusiasms; and Gabriel Rossetti laughed at him a good deal. On one
occasion D.G.R. let off the following "nursery rhyme":&mdash;</p>

<p>
There's a fluffy-haired German called Huffer<br />
A loud and pragmatical duffer:<br />
To stand on a tower<br />
And shout "Schopenhauer"<br />
Is reckoned his mission by Huffer.<br />
</p>

<p>There was no malice in these rhymes of Rossetti's; but even his dear
friend Morris ("Topsy" as his intimates called him on account of his
shock of black hair) was not exempt from personal sallies of the
kind,&mdash;as this, when M. got alarmed about his increasing bulk:&mdash;</p>

<p>
There was a young person called Topsy<br />
Who fancied he suffered from dropsy;<br />
He shook like a jelly,<br />
Till the Doctor cried "Belly!"&mdash;<br />
Which angered; but comforted Topsy.<br />
</p>

<p>Poor dear Morris! he had cause enough for alarm. Diabetes was only one
among the agencies by which his stalwart frame was disintegrated at the
age of 62.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR</h2>
<h3>OF</h3>
<h2>WILLIAM MORRIS.</h2>


<p>William Morris, poet, decorative designer and socialist, was born in
1834 at Clay Street, Walthamstow, now almost a suburb of London, at that
time a country village in Essex. He went to school at Marlborough
College and thence to Exeter College, Oxford, where he took his degree
in 1857. During his stay in the University the subsequent mode of his
life was prepared and foreshadowed in two important directions. Like
most poets Morris was not what is called very assiduous "at his book";
the routine of college training was no more an attraction to him than
the ordinary amusements and dissipations of undergraduate existence. But
he was studious all the same, reading the classics in his own somewhat
spasmodic way and exploring with even greater zeal the mysteries of
medi&aelig;val lore. His fellow-worker in these studies and his most intimate
friend was and is at the present day Mr. Burne Jones, the famous
painter, at that time a student of divinity. Artistic and literary
pursuits thus went hand in hand, and received additional zest when the
two young men became acquainted with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Holman Hunt
and other painters of the Pre-Raphaelite school who came to Oxford to
execute the frescoes still dimly visible on the ceiling of the Union
Debating Hall. Of the aims and achievements of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood, and of the revival of medi&aelig;val feeling in art and
literature originally advocated by its members ample account has been
given in the memoir of Rossetti prefixed to his poems in the Tauchnitz
edition. Its influence on Morris's early work, both in matter and form,
will strike every observant reader of the opening ballads of the present
collection. Later on the poet worked out for himself a distinct and
individual phase of the medi&aelig;val movement, as will be mentioned by and
by. At one time little was wanting to make Morris follow his friend
Burne Jones's example and leave the pen for the brush. There is indeed
still extant from his hand an unfinished picture evincing a remarkable
sense of colour. He also for a short time became a pupil of the late Mr.
G. E. Street, the architect, to whose genius London owes its finest
modern Gothic building&mdash;the Law Courts in the Strand. On second
thoughts, however, Morris came to the conclusion that poetry was his
true field of action. His first literary venture was a monthly
periodical started under his auspices in 1856 and called <i>The Oxford and
Cambridge Magazine</i>. It contained, amongst other contributions from
Morris's pen, a prose tale of a highly romantic character, and was, as
regards artistic tendencies, essentially a sequel of <i>The Germ</i>, the
organ of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, begun and continued for three
numbers only, six years before. Several of the contributors to the
earlier venture, including Rossetti, also supported its offshoot.
Neither, however, gained popular favour, and after a year's struggling
existence <i>The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</i> also came to an untimely
end. At present both are eagerly sought for by collectors and fetch high
prices at antiquarian sales. So changeable is the fate of books.</p>

<p>In 1859 Morris married, after having the year before brought out his
first volume of verse entitled <i>The Defence of Guenevere and Other
Poems</i>. The book fell dead from the press, and it was not till it was
republished 25 years later that the world recognised in it some of the
freshest and most individual efforts of its author, whose literary
position was by that time established beyond cavil. That position the
poet owed in the first instance to two works published in rapid
succession, <i>The Life and Death of Jason</i>, and <i>The Earthly Paradise</i>,
the latter a collection of tales in verse filling four stout volumes.
His remaining original works are <i>Love is enough</i>, a "morality" in the
medi&aelig;val sense of the word, and <i>The Story of Sigurd the Volsung</i>, his
longest and, in the opinion of some, his most perfect epic. In addition
to these should be mentioned the translations from the old Norse
undertaken in conjunction with Mr. Magnusson the well-known Icelandic
scholar, and comprising <i>The Story of Grettir the Strong</i> (1869), <i>The
Volsunga Saga, with certain songs from the Elder Edda</i> (1870), and
<i>Three Northern Love Stories</i> (1875); and finally a metrical rendering
of <i>The &AElig;neids of Virgil</i>.</p>

<p>For a critical discussion or a detailed analysis of Morris's work this
is not the place. It must be sufficient to indicate briefly the ideas
which underlie that work and give it its literary <i>cachet</i>. Two main
currents, derivable perhaps from a common source but running in
different directions can be easily discerned. The subjects of his tales
are almost without exception derived either from Greek myth or from
medi&aelig;val folklore. After all that has been said and written of the gulf
that divides the classic from the romantic feeling&mdash;<i>"Barbaren und
Hellenen</i>", as Heine puts it, such a conjunction might appear
incongruous. But the connecting link has here been found in the poet's
mind. He looks upon his classical subject-matter through a medi&aelig;val
atmosphere, in other words he writes about Venus and Cupid and Psyche
and Medea as a poet of Chaucer's age might have done, barring of course
the differences of language, although in this respect also it may be
noted that the archaisms of expression affected by the modern poet
appear indifferently in the Greek and the medi&aelig;val tales. The phenomenon
is by no means unique in literature. Let the reader compare Chapman's
Homer with Pope's, or let him open Morris's <i>Jason</i> where the bells of
Colchis "melodiously begin to ring", and the meaning of the
afore-mentioned "medi&aelig;val atmosphere" will at once be as palpable to him
as it was to Keats when, reading Chapman's rude verse, after Pope's
polished stanzas, he felt</p>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">like some watcher of the skies</span>
<span class="i0">When a new planet swims into his ken.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the romantic chord of Keats's nature, that chord which vibrates
in <i>La belle Dame sans Merci</i>, which was harmoniously struck and made
the great master of form overlook the formal imperfection of the
earlier poet. To the same element such stories as <i>Jason</i>, or <i>The Love
of Alcestis</i> and the <i>Bellerophon</i> in <i>The Earthly Paradise</i> owe their
charm.</p>

<p>Morris's position towards medi&aelig;val subjects did not at first essentially
differ from that of other poets of similar tendency. In his first volume
English and French knights and damsels figure prominently, and the
beautiful and frail wife of King Arthur is the heroine of the chief poem
and has given her name to the book. But in the interval which elapsed
between that volume and the <i>Earthly Paradise</i> a considerable change had
come over the poet's dream. By the aid of Mr. Magnusson he had become
acquainted with the treasure of northern folklore hidden in the
Icelandic sagas, the two Eddas, the story of the Volsungs (of which a
masterly translation is due to the two friends), the Laxd&aelig;la saga and
other tales of more or less remote antiquity.</p>

<p>In the <i>Earthly Paradise</i> the double current of the poet's fancy above
alluded to is most strikingly apparent. The very framework in which the
various tales are set seems to have been designed with that view. Guided
probably by a vague tradition of a pre-Columbian discovery of America by
the Vikings, the prologue relates how during a terrible pestilence
certain mariners leave their northern home in search of the land where
old age and death are not and where life is rounded by unbroken
pleasure. Sailing west they come to a fair country. They gaze on
southern sunshine and virgin forest and fertile champaign, but death
meets them at every step, and happiness is farthest from their grasp
when the people worship them as gods and sacrifice at their shrine.
Escaping from this golden thraldom they regain their ship, and after
many dangers and privations are driven by the wind to an island
inhabited by descendants of the ancient Greeks, who have preserved their
old worship and their old freedom. Here the weary wanderers of the main
are hospitably received, and here they resolve to dwell in peace,
forgetful of their vain search for the earthly paradise. At the
beginning and the middle of every month the elders of the people and
their guests meet together to while away the time with song and friendly
converse. The islanders relate the traditions of their Grecian home, the
mariners relate the sagas of the North, and Laurence, a Swabian priest
who had joined the Norsemen in their quest, contributes the legends of
Tannh&auml;user and of the ring given to Venus by the Roman youth. Here then
there is full scope for the quaint beauty of romantic classicism and for
the weird glamour of northern myth. Without encroaching upon the field
of criticism proper the writer may state that, in his opinion, amongst
the classic tales none is more graceful and finished than "The Golden
Apples", and amongst the northern none more grandly developed and more
epical in the strict sense of the word than <i>The Lovers of Gudrun</i> based
upon the Icelandic Laxd&aelig;la saga. The latter, unfortunately, cannot find
a place in this volume for reasons of space.</p>

<p>Every student of old northern literature is aware that amongst its
remains none are more interesting as literary monuments, none more
characteristic of the people from which they sprang than the two Eddas
and the Volsunga Saga. Next to the Siege of Troy and the Arthurian
legends perhaps no story or agglomeration of stories has left so many
and so important traces in international fiction as the tale of Sigurd
or Siegfried and his race, the heroic god-born Volsungs. Considering
indeed the political insignificance and remoteness in which that story
took its earliest surviving form this enormous success&mdash;if the modern
term may be applied&mdash;seems at first singularly out of proportion. But it
must be remembered that Iceland was little more than the storehouse of
these old traditions which were the common property of the
Teuto-Scandinavian race long before the Norsemen set foot on the
northern isle. Of the two modern versions of the tale which are most
thoroughly inspired by the ancient myth one, that of Wagner in his
tetralogy <i>Der Ring des Nibelungen</i>, is dramatic in form, the other,
Morris's <i>The Story of Sigurd the Volsung</i>, bears all the
characteristics of the epic. To this difference of artistic aim, the
difference of shape which the tale takes in the hands of the two poets
may be traced. In one point however they agree. Both Wagner and Morris
go back to the old Icelandic sources in preference to the medi&aelig;val
German version of the tale embodied in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>. From this
the German poet borrows little more than the localization of his drama
on the banks of the river Rhine, the English poet scarcely anything but
his metre&mdash;the <i>Langzeile</i> or long-line with six hightoned, and any
number of unaccentuated syllables.</p>

<p>The ordinary modern reader taking up the Volsunga Saga or either of the
Eddas without preparation would probably see in them little more than a
confused accumulation of impossible adventures and deeds of prowess with
an admixture of incest, fratricide and other horrors. But on looking
closer one discovers a certain plan in this entanglement, a plan much
obscured by the unbridled fancy of the old narrators, and hardly
realised by themselves, but which, if properly sifted, amounts to what
we should call a moral or idea. To "point this moral," to consistently
develop this idea, is the task of the modern poet courageous enough to
grapple with such a subject. Two ways are open to him. Either he may
wholly abandon the sequence of the old tale, and group its <i>disjecta
membra</i> round a leading idea as a centre, or else he may adhere to the
order and essence of the legend as originally told, only emphasising
such points as are essential to the significance of the story, and
omitting or throwing into comparative shade those incidents which by
their nature betray themselves to be arbitrary additions of later date.
Wagner has chosen the former way, Morris the latter. This fact, and the
divergent requirements of the drama and the epic, sufficiently account
for their difference of treatment. The leading idea in both cases
remains the same; it is the fatal curse which attaches to the gold or,
which is the same in a moral sense, to the desire for gold&mdash;<i>auri sacra
fames</i>.</p>

<p>At first sight the tale of Sigurd, Fafnir's bane, seems to have little
connection with this idea. It is briefly this. Sigurd, the son of
Sigmund the Volsung, is brought up at the court of King Elf, the second
husband of his mother, after Sigmund has been slain in battle. With a
sword, fashioned from the shards of his father's weapon, he slays
Fafnir, a huge worm or dragon, and possesses himself of the treasure
watched by the monster, including a ring and the "helm of aweing," the
latter in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, converted into the "Tarnkappe", a magic
cap which makes the bearer invisible and endows him with supernatural
strength. Tasting of the blood of the dragon, he understands the
language of birds, and an eagle tells him of a beautiful maiden lying
asleep on a rock called Hindfell, surrounded by a wall of wavering fire.
Through it Sigurd rides and awakes Brynhild the sword maiden, or
Valkyrie, from her magic slumber. Love naturally follows. The pair live
together on Hindfell for a season and Brynhild teaches the youth the
runes of her wisdom, a conception of woman's refining and civilising
mission frequently met with in old Germanic tales. When Sigurd leaves
her to seek new adventures they plight the troth of eternal love, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he set the ring on her finger, and once if ne'er again</span>
<span class="i0">They kissed and clung together, and their hearts were full and fain.</span>
</div></div>

<p>From Brynhild's rock Sigurd journeys to a realm "south of the Rhine"
where dwell the kingly brothers, Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm, the
Niblungs, together with their sister Gudrun, "the fairest of maidens",
and their mother Grimhild, "a wise wife" and a fierce-hearted woman, as
the Volsunga Saga alternately describes her. It is through a
love-philter brewed by her that Sigurd forgets the vows exchanged with
Brynhild, and becomes enamoured of Gudrun, whom he soon after weds. So
powerful is the charm that the very name of his former love has been
wiped from Sigurd's memory, and he willingly undertakes the task to woo
and win Brynhild for his brother Gunnar. For that purpose he, by means
of his magic cap, assumes Gunnar's semblance, and after having once
more crossed the wall of wavering flame compels Brynhild to become his
bride. But, faithful to his promise, he places a drawn sword between
himself and the maid "as they lie on one bed together." On parting from
her he receives back from Brynhild his own ring given to her at Hindfell
in the days of their bliss. Sigurd then returns to Gunnar and resumes
his own form, and all return home, the King leading his unwilling bride
in triumph.</p>

<p>The subsequent events are the outgrowth of the tragic guilt thus
incurred. Sigurd reveals the secret of Brynhild's wooing to his wife,
and allows her to take possession of the fatal ring, which she during a
quarrel shows to Gunnar's wife. Brynhild thus informed of the fraud
practised on her, thinks of vengeance, and incites her husband and his
brothers to kill Sigurd. The deed is done while Sigurd lies asleep in
his chamber with Gudrun, or, according to the more poetic version of the
German epic, while he bends over a brook in the forest to quench his
thirst after a day's hunting. But as soon as her beloved foe is killed
the old passion never quenched rises up again in Brynhild's heart. To be
united with her lover in death she pierces her breast with a sword, and
one pyre consumes both.</p>

<p>With this climax Wagner very properly concludes his drama. But the epic
poet likes to follow the course of events to their ultimate
consequences, and Morris, in accordance with the Volsunga Saga, proceeds
to relate how, after many years of mournful widowhood, Gudrun is married
to Atli, a mighty king, the brother of Brynhild. Eager to become
possessed of Sigurd's treasure he invites the Niblungs, its actual
owners, to his country, and there the kingly brothers and all their
followers are killed by base treachery and after the most heroic
resistance. They refuse sternly to ransom their lives by a discovery of
the hoard which previous to their departure they have hidden at the
bottom of a lake, and which thus is irrecoverably lost to mankind.
Gudrun has incited her husband to the deed and has looked on calmly
while her kinsmen were slain one after the other. But when all are dead
and the murder of Sigurd has been revenged, the feeling of blood
relationship so powerful among Northern nations is reawakened in her.
While Atli and his earls are asleep she sets fire to the kingly hall,
and her wretched husband falls by her own hand. It is characteristic of
the Icelandic epic that after all these fates and horrors Gudrun lives
for a number of years and is yet again married to a third husband. But
to this length even Morris refuses to accompany the tale. In accordance
with the Volsunga Saga his Gudrun throws herself into the sea; but the
waves do not carry her "to the burg of king Imakr, a mighty king and
lord of many folk."</p>

<p>All this is very grand and weird, the reader will say, but where is the
moral, the ideal essence of which these events are but the earthly
reflex? To this essence we gradually ascend by inquiring into the
mythological sources of the tale, by asking who is Sigurd, whence does
he come, on what mission is he sent and by whom? also what is the
significance of the treasure watched by a dragon and coveted by all
mankind? This treasure we then shall find and the curse attaching to it
ever since it was robbed from Andvari, the water-elf, is the keynote of
the whole story. The curse proves fatal to all its successive owners
from Andvari himself and Fafnir, who, for its sake, kills his father,
down to Sigurd and Brynhild and the Niblung brothers. Nay, Odin himself,
the supreme God, becomes subject to the curse of the gold through having
once coveted it, and we dimly discern that the ultimate doom of the
Aesir, the Ragnar&ouml;k, or dusk of the Gods, of which the Voluspa speaks,
is intimately connected with the same baneful influence. It further
becomes evident that Sigurd the Volsung, the descendant of Odin, is
destined to wrest the treasure and the power derived from it from the
Niblungs, the dark or cloudy people who threaten the bright godworld of
Valhall with destruction. And this leads us back to a still earlier
stage of the myth in which Sigurd himself becomes the symbol of the
celestial luminary conquering night and misty darkness, an idea
repeatedly hinted at by Morris and splendidly illustrated by Wagner,
when Siegfried appears on the stage illumined by the first rays of the
rising sun. In the work of the German poet all this is brought out with
a distinctness of which only dramatic genius of the highest order is
capable. With an astounding grasp of detail and with a continuity of
thought rarely equalled, Wagner has remoulded the confused and complex
argument of the old tale, omitting what seemed unnecessary, and placing
in juxtaposition incidents organically connected but separated by the
obtuseness of later sagamen.</p>

<p>Morris, as has been said before, proceeds on a different principle. His
first object is to tell a tale, and to tell it as nearly as possible in
the spirit and according to the letter of the old Sagas. In this he has
succeeded in a manner at once indicative of his high poetic gifts and of
a deep sympathy with the spirit of the Northern Myth, which breathes in
every line and in every turn of his phraseology. To compare the peculiar
tinge of his language with the ordinary archaisms and euphonisms of
literary poets would be mistaking a field flower for its counterpart in
a milliner's shop window. It is true that he also hints at the larger
philosophic and moral issues of the tale. But when he refers to the end
of the gods brought about by their own guilt or to the redeeming mission
of Sigurd, it is done in the mysterious, not to say half conscious
manner of the saga itself, and the effect is such as from his own point
of view he intended it and could not but intend it to be.</p>

<p>Between the publication of <i>The Defence of Guenevere</i> and that of Jason
ten years elapsed. During most of this time the poet was employed in
artistic pursuits. In 1861 he started in conjunction with a number of
friends the business of decorator and artistic designer which still
bears his name. Growing from very modest beginnings this enterprise was
destined to work an entire change in the external aspect of English
homes. It soon extended its activity to every branch of art-workmanship.
D. G. Rossetti, Madox Brown, and Burne Jones drew cartoons for the
stained glass windows to be seen in many of our churches and colleges.
Morris himself designed wall-papers and the patterns of carpets. The
latter are woven on hand-looms in his factory at Merton Abbey, which
stands on the banks of the river Wandle surrounded by orchards, and
looks as like a medieval workshop as the modern dresses of the workgirls
will allow. Another member of the firm, Philip Webb, was the first
modern architect to build houses of red brick in the style vaguely and
not quite correctly described as "Queen Anne." At present these houses
count by thousands in London and a whole village of them has been built
at Turnham Green. The members of the firm did not confine their
attention to any particular style or age or country. Wherever beautiful
things could be found they collected them and made them popular. Old
china English, and foreign, Japanese fans and screens, Venetian glass
and German pottery were equally welcome to them and through them to the
public generally. It may be said that the "aesthetic" fashion as it came
to be called will like other fashions die out, and that people in the
course of time will grow tired of "living up to" their furniture and
dresses. At the same time the idea thus insisted upon that beauty is an
essential and necessary ingredient of practical modern English life is
not likely to be without beneficial and permanent effect.</p>

<p>It was as artistic worker and employer of skilled labour that Morris
imbibed that profound disgust with our social condition which induced
him to adopt the principles of extreme socialism. For a long time his
views had tended in that direction, and at the end of 1884 he joined the
Socialist League, a body professing the doctrines of international
revolutionary socialism. He is the editor of its official organ, the
<i>Commonweal</i>, which contains many contributions from his pen both in
prose and verse. That the poet has not been entirely sunk in the
politician, that longing for beauty is at least the partial cause of
this desire for change at any price, is however proved by such a
sentiment as, "Beauty, which is what is meant by <i>art</i>, using the word
in its widest sense, is, I contend, no mere accident of human life which
people can take or have as they choose, but a positive necessity of
life, if we are to live as nature meant us to, that is unless we are
content to be less than men," or by such a vision of a future earthly
paradise as is expressed in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a man shall work and bethink him, and rejoice in the deeds of his hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet come home in the even, too faint and weary to stand,</span>
<span class="i0">.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</span>
<span class="i0">For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed.</span>
<span class="i0">.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</span>
<span class="i0">Then all <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> shall be <i>ours</i>, and no more shall any man crave</span>
<span class="i0">For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave.</span>
</div></div>

<p>One may admire the pathetic beauty of such lines, without sharing the
poet's hope, that their import will ever be realised, in a world peopled
by men and not by angels. History teaches and personal experience
confirms that art enjoyment and art creation of the highest type must be
confined to the few, and it is to be feared that social democracy,
whatever it may do for the physical welfare of the many, will care
little about beauty, either in nature or in art. The <i>Demos</i> will never
admire Rossetti's pictures or Keats's poetry, and the first thing the
much-vaunted peasant proprietors, or peasant communes would do would be
to cut down our ancient trees, level every hedgerow and turn parks and
commons into potato plots or it may be turnip fields. One may feel
certain of all this and yet admire the author of <i>The Earthly
Paradise</i>, "the idle singer of an empty day" when he preaches universal
brotherhood in the crossways of Hammersmith, and wrestles with
policemen, or wrangles with obtuse magistrates about the freedom of
speech. Conviction thus upheld at the cost of worldly advantage and
personal convenience and taste must command respect even from those who
cannot share it.</p>

<span class="i0">&nbsp;But, knowing now that they would have her speak,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;She threw her wet hair backward from her brow,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;As though she had had there a shameful blow,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;She must a little touch it; like one lame</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"O knights and lords, it seems but little skill</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;To talk of well-known things past now and dead.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And pray you all forgiveness heartily!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Because you must be right such great lords&mdash;still</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Listen, suppose your time were come to die,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And you were quite alone and very weak;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Yea, laid a dying while very mightily</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Of river through your broad lands running well:</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Now choose one cloth for ever, which they be,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I will not tell you, you must somehow tell</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!'</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;At foot of your familiar bed to see</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"A great God's angel standing, with such dyes,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Held out two ways, light from the inner skies</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Showing him well, and making his commands</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Seem to be God's commands, moreover, too,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;No man could tell the better of the two.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'After a shivering half-hour you said,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;'God help! heaven's colour, the blue;' and he said, 'hell.'</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And cry to all good men that loved you well,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;'Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;'</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Launcelot went away, then I could tell,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And roll and hurt myself, and long to die,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And yet fear much to die for what was sown.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Whatever may have happened through these years,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Her voice was low at first, being full of tears,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Growing a windy shriek in all men's ears,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;A ringing in their startled brains, until</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And her great eyes began again to fill,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;With passionate twisting of her body there:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"It chanced upon a day Launcelot came</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;To dwell at Arthur's Court; at Christmas-time</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;This happened; when the heralds sung his name,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Son of King Ban of Benwick,' seemed to chime</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Along with all the bells that rang that day,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;O'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Christmas and whitened winter passed away,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And over me the April sunshine came,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And in the Summer I grew white with flame,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And bowed my head down&mdash;Autumn, and the sick</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Sure knowledge things would never be the same,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"However often Spring might be most thick</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;My eager body; while I laughed out loud,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And let my lips curl up at false or true,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Behold my judges, then the cloths were brought:</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Belonging to the time ere I was bought</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;By Arthur's great name and his little love,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Must I give up for ever then, I thought,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"That which I deemed would ever round me move</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Glorifying all things; for a little word,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Will that all folks should be quite happy and good?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I love God now a little, if this cord</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Were broken, once for all what striving could</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Make me love anything in earth or heaven.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;So day by day it grew, as if one should</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Down to a cool sea on a summer day;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Until one surely reached the sea at last,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"In the lone sea, far off from any ships!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Do I not know now of a day in Spring?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;No minute of that wild day ever slips</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And wheresoever I may be, straightway</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I was half mad with beauty on that day,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And went without my ladies all alone,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;In a quiet garden walled round every way;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I was right joyful of that wall of stone,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"A little thing just then had made me mad;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I dared not think, as I was wont to do,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Held out my long hand up against the blue,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Round by the edges; what should I have done,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And startling green drawn upward by the sun?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And trancedly stood watching the west wind run</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"With faintest half-heard breathing sound&mdash;why there</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I lose my head e'en now in doing this;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;But shortly listen&mdash;In that garden fair</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"When both our mouths went wandering in one way,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And aching sorely, met among the leaves;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Our hands being left behind strained far away.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Never within a yard of my bright sleeves</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Had Launcelot come before&mdash;and now, so nigh!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Whatever happened on through all those years,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Being such a lady could I weep these tears</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;If this were true? A great queen such as I</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Having sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And afterwards she liveth hatefully,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Do I not see how God's dear pity creeps</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Buried in some place far down in the south,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Men are forgetting as I speak to you;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;By her head sever'd in that awful drouth</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Of pity that drew Agravaine's fell blow,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I pray your pity! let me not scream out</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For ever after, when the shrill winds blow</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For ever after in the winter night</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;When you ride out alone! in battle-rout</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Let not my rusting tears make your sword light!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Ah! God of mercy how he turns away!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;So, ever must I dress me to the fight,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"So&mdash;let God's justice work! Gauwaine, I say,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"One bitter day in <i>la Fausse Garde</i>, for so</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;All good knights held it after, saw&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;This Mellyagraunce saw blood upon my bed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Whose blood then pray you? is there any law</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"To make a queen say why some spots of red</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Lie on her coverlet? or will you say,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;'Your hands are white, lady, as when you wed,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Where did you bleed?' and must I stammer out&mdash;'Nay',</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I blush indeed, fair lord, only to rend</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;My sleeve up to my shoulder, where there lay</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'A knife-point last night:' so must I defend</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;The honour of the lady Guenevere?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Not so, fair lords, even if the world should end</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"This very day, and you were judges here</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Instead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;His side sink in? as my knight cried and said,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;'Slayer of unarm'd men, here is a chance!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;By God I am so glad to fight with you,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For all my wounds are moving in my breast,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And I am getting mad with waiting so.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"He struck his hands together o'er the beast,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Who fell down flat, and grovell'd at his feet,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And groan'd at being slain so young&mdash;'at least.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"My knight said, 'Rise you, sir, who are so fleet</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;At catching ladies, half-arm'd will I fight,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;My left side all uncover'd!' then I weet,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Upon his knave's face; not until just then</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Along the lists look to my stake and pen</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;From agony beneath my waist-chain, when</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And traversed warily, and ever high</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And fast leapt caitiff's sword, until my knight</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Caught it, and swung it; that was all the fight.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Except a spout of blood on the hot land;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For it was hottest summer; and I know</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I wonder'd how the fire, while I should stand,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Yards above my head; thus these matters went:</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Which things were only warnings of the woe</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"With all this wickedness; say no rash word</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Wept all away the grey, may bring some sword</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yea also at my full heart's strong command,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;See through my long throat how the words go up</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"The shadow lies like wine within a cup</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Of marvellously colour'd gold; yea now</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;This little wind is rising, look you up,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And wonder how the light is falling so</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Within my moving tresses: will you dare</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;When you have looked a little on my brow,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"To say this thing is vile? or will you care</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For any plausible lies of cunning woof,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;When you can see my face with no lie there</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"For ever? am I not a gracious proof&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;'But in your chamber Launcelot was found'&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;'O true as steel come now and talk with me,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I love to see your step upon the ground</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Unwavering, also well I love to see</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;That gracious smile light up your face, and hear</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Your wonderful words, that all mean verily</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;To me in everything, come here to-night,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'If you come not, I fear this time I might</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Get thinking over much of times gone by,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;When I was young, and green hope was in sight:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'For no man cares now to know why I sigh;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;To see you, Launcelot; that we may be</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Like children once again, free from all wrongs</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Just for one night.' Did he not come to me?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;What thing could keep true Launcelot away</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;If I said 'Come?' there was one less than three</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I looked at Launcelot's face and could not speak,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;For he looked helpless too, for a little while;</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Then I remember how I tried to shriek,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;The stones they threw up rattled o'er my head</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And made me dizzier; till within a while</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"My maids were all about me, and my head</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;On Launcelot's breast was being soothed away</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;From its white chattering, until Launcelot said&mdash;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"By God! I will not tell you more to-day,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Judge any way you will&mdash;what matters it?</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;You know quite well the story of that fray,</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"How Launcelot still'd their bawling, the mad fit</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;That caught up Gauwaine&mdash;all, all, verily,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;But just that which would save me; these things flit.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Whatever may have happen'd these long years,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"All I have said is truth, by Christ's dear tears."</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;She would not speak another word, but stood</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Turn'd sideways; listening, like a man who hears</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;His brother's trumpet sounding through the wood</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Of his foe's lances. She lean'd eagerly,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">&nbsp;At last hear something really; joyfully</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Of the roan charger drew all men to see,</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;The knight who came was Launcelot at good need.</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This castle where I dwell, it stands</span>
<span class="i0">A long way off from Christian lands,</span>
<span class="i0">A long way off my lady's hands,</span>
<span class="i0">A long way off the aspen trees,</span>
<span class="i0">And murmur of the lime-tree bees.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But down the Valley of the Rose</span>
<span class="i0">My lady often hawking goes,</span>
<span class="i0">Heavy of cheer; oft turns behind,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaning towards the western wind,</span>
<span class="i0">Because it bringeth to her mind</span>
<span class="i0">Sad whisperings of happy times,</span>
<span class="i0">The face of him who sings these rhymes.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">King Guilbert rides beside her there,</span>
<span class="i0">Bends low and calls her very fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And strives, by pulling down his hair,</span>
<span class="i0">To hide from my dear lady's ken</span>
<span class="i0">The grisly gash I gave him, when</span>
<span class="i0">I cut him down at Camelot;</span>
<span class="i0">However he strives, he hides it not,</span>
<span class="i0">That tourney will not be forgot,</span>
<span class="i0">Besides, it is King Guilbert's lot,</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever he says she answers not.</span>
<span class="i0">Now tell me, you that are in love,</span>
<span class="i0">From the king's son to the wood-dove,</span>
<span class="i0">Which is the better, he or I?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">For this king means that I should die</span>
<span class="i0">In this lone Pagan castle, where</span>
<span class="i0">The flowers droop in the bad air</span>
<span class="i0">On the September evening.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Look, now I take mine ease and sing,</span>
<span class="i0">Counting as but a little thing</span>
<span class="i0">The foolish spite of a bad king.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">For these vile things that hem me in,</span>
<span class="i0">These Pagan beasts who live in sin,</span>
<span class="i0">The sickly flowers pale and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">The grim blue-bearded castellan,</span>
<span class="i0">The stanchions half worn-out with rust,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereto their banner vile they trust&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Why, all these things I hold them just</span>
<span class="i0">Like dragons in a missal book,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein, whenever we may look,</span>
<span class="i0">We see no horror, yea, delight</span>
<span class="i0">We have, the colours are so bright;</span>
<span class="i0">Likewise we note the specks of white,</span>
<span class="i0">And the great plates of burnish'd gold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Just so this Pagan castle old,</span>
<span class="i0">And everything I can see there,</span>
<span class="i0">Sick-pining in the marshland air,</span>
<span class="i0">I note; I will go over now,</span>
<span class="i0">Like one who paints with knitted brow,</span>
<span class="i0">The flowers and all things one by one,</span>
<span class="i0">From the snail on the wall to the setting sun.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Four great walls, and a little one</span>
<span class="i0">That leads down to the barbican,</span>
<span class="i0">Which walls with many spears they man,</span>
<span class="i0">When news comes to the castellan</span>
<span class="i0">Of Launcelot being in the land.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And as I sit here, close at hand</span>
<span class="i0">Four spikes of sad sick sunflowers stand,</span>
<span class="i0">The castellan with a long wand</span>
<span class="i0">Cuts down their leaves as he goes by,</span>
<span class="i0">Ponderingly, with screw'd-up eye,</span>
<span class="i0">And fingers twisted in his beard&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, was it a knight's shout I heard?</span>
<span class="i0">I have a hope makes me afeard:</span>
<span class="i0">It cannot be, but if some dream</span>
<span class="i0">Just for a minute made me deem</span>
<span class="i0">I saw among the flowers there</span>
<span class="i0">My lady's face with long red hair,</span>
<span class="i0">Pale, ivory-colour'd dear face come,</span>
<span class="i0">As I was wont to see her some</span>
<span class="i0">Fading September afternoon,</span>
<span class="i0">And kiss me, saying nothing, soon</span>
<span class="i0">To leave me by myself again;</span>
<span class="i2">Could I get this by longing: vain!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">The castellan is gone: I see</span>
<span class="i0">On one broad yellow flower a bee</span>
<span class="i0">Drunk with much honey&mdash;</span>
<span class="i8">Christ! again,</span>
<span class="i0">Some distant knight's voice brings me pain,</span>
<span class="i0">I thought I had forgot to feel,</span>
<span class="i0">I never heard the blissful steel</span>
<span class="i0">These ten years past; year after year,</span>
<span class="i0">Through all my hopeless sojourn here,</span>
<span class="i0">No Christian pennon has been near;</span>
<span class="i0">Laus Deo! the dragging wind draws on</span>
<span class="i0">Over the marches, battle won,</span>
<span class="i0">Knights' shouts, and axes hammering,</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, quicker now the dint and ring</span>
<span class="i0">Of flying hoofs; ah, castellan,</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had she come all the way for this,</span>
<span class="i0">To part at last without a kiss?</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, had she borne the dirt and rain</span>
<span class="i0">That her own eyes might see him slain</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the haystack in the floods?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Along the dripping leafless woods,</span>
<span class="i0">The stirrup touching either shoe,</span>
<span class="i0">She rode astride as troopers do;</span>
<span class="i0">With kirtle kilted to her knee,</span>
<span class="i0">To which the mud splash'd wretchedly;</span>
<span class="i0">And the wet dripp'd from every tree</span>
<span class="i0">Upon her head and heavy hair,</span>
<span class="i0">And on her eyelids broad and fair;</span>
<span class="i0">The tears and rain ran down her face.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">By fits and starts they rode apace,</span>
<span class="i0">And very often was his place</span>
<span class="i0">Far off from her; he had to ride</span>
<span class="i0">Ahead, to see what might betide</span>
<span class="i0">When the road cross'd; and sometimes, when</span>
<span class="i0">There rose a murmuring from his men,</span>
<span class="i0">Had to turn back with promises;</span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! she had but little ease;</span>
<span class="i0">And often for pure doubt and dread</span>
<span class="i0">She sobb'd, made giddy in the head</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">By the swift riding; while, for cold,</span>
<span class="i0">Her slender fingers scarce could hold</span>
<span class="i0">The wet reins; yea, and scarcely, too,</span>
<span class="i0">She felt the foot within her shoe</span>
<span class="i0">Against the stirrup: all for this,</span>
<span class="i0">To part at last without a kiss</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the haystack in the floods.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">For when they near'd that old soak'd hay,</span>
<span class="i0">They saw across the only way</span>
<span class="i0">That Judas, Godmar, and the three</span>
<span class="i0">Red running lions dismally</span>
<span class="i0">Grinn'd from his pennon, under which</span>
<span class="i0">In one straight line along the ditch,</span>
<span class="i0">They counted thirty heads.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i8">So then,</span>
<span class="i0">While Robert turn'd round to his men,</span>
<span class="i0">She saw at once the wretched end,</span>
<span class="i0">And, stooping down, tried hard to rend</span>
<span class="i0">Her coif the wrong way from her head,</span>
<span class="i0">And hid her eyes; while Robert said:</span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, love, 'tis scarcely two to one,</span>
<span class="i0">At Poictiers where we made them run</span>
<span class="i0">So fast&mdash;why, sweet my love, good cheer,</span>
<span class="i0">The Gascon frontier is so near,</span>
<span class="i0">Nought after this."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i8">But, "O," she said,</span>
<span class="i0">"My God! my God! I have to tread</span>
<span class="i0">The long way back without you; then</span>
<span class="i0">The court at Paris; those six men;</span>
<span class="i0">The gratings of the Chatelet;</span>
<span class="i0">The swift Seine on some rainy day</span>
<span class="i0">Like this, and people standing by,</span>
<span class="i0">And laughing, while my weak hands try</span>
<span class="i0">To recollect how strong men swim.</span>
<span class="i0">All this, or else a life with him,</span>
<span class="i0">For which I should be damned at last,</span>
<span class="i0">Would God that this next hour were past!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">He answer'd not, but cried his cry,</span>
<span class="i0">"St. George for Marny!" cheerily;</span>
<span class="i0">And laid his hand upon her rein.</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! no man of all his train</span>
<span class="i0">Gave back that cheery cry again;</span>
<span class="i0">And, while for rage his thumb beat fast</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his sword-hilt, some one cast</span>
<span class="i0">About his neck a kerchief long,</span>
<span class="i0">And bound him.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i8">Then they went along</span>
<span class="i0">To Godmar; who said: "Now, Jehane,</span>
<span class="i0">Your lover's life is on the wane</span>
<span class="i0">So fast, that, if this very hour</span>
<span class="i0">You yield not as my paramour,</span>
<span class="i0">He will not see the rain leave off&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, keep your tongue from gibe and scoff,</span>
<span class="i0">Sir Robert, or I slay you now."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">She laid her hand upon her brow,</span>
<span class="i0">Then gazed upon the palm, as though</span>
<span class="i0">She thought her forehead bled, and&mdash;"No,"</span>
<span class="i0">She said, and turn'd her head away,</span>
<span class="i0">As there were nothing else to say,</span>
<span class="i0">And everything were settled: red</span>
<span class="i0">Grew Godmar's face from chin to head:</span>
<span class="i0">"Jehane, on yonder hill there stands</span>
<span class="i0">My castle, guarding well my lands:</span>
<span class="i0">What hinders me from taking you,</span>
<span class="i0">And doing that I list to do</span>
<span class="i0">To your fair wilful body, while</span>
<span class="i0">Your knight lies dead?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i8">A wicked smile</span>
<span class="i0">Wrinkled her face, her lips grew thin,</span>
<span class="i0">A long way out she thrust her chin:</span>
<span class="i0">"You know that I should strangle you</span>
<span class="i0">While you were sleeping; or bite through</span>
<span class="i0">Your throat, by God's help&mdash;ah!" she said,</span>
<span class="i0">"Lord Jesus, pity your poor maid!</span>
<span class="i0">For in such wise they hem me in,</span>
<span class="i0">I cannot choose but sin and sin,</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever happens: yet I think</span>
<span class="i0">They could not make me eat or drink,</span>
<span class="i0">And so should I just reach my rest."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nay, if you do not my behest,</span>
<span class="i0">O Jehane! though I love you well,"</span>
<span class="i0">Said Godmar, "would I fail to tell</span>
<span class="i0">All that I know." "Foul lies," she said.</span>
<span class="i0">"Eh? lies, my Jehane? by God's head,</span>
<span class="i0">At Paris folks would deem them true!</span>
<span class="i0">Do you know, Jehane, they cry for you,</span>
<span class="i0">'Jehane the brown! Jehane the brown!</span>
<span class="i0">Give us Jehane to burn or drown!'&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Eh&mdash;gag me, Robert!&mdash;sweet my friend,</span>
<span class="i0">This were indeed a piteous end</span>
<span class="i0">For those long fingers, and long feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And long neck, and smooth shoulders sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">An end that few men would forget</span>
<span class="i0">That saw it&mdash;So, an hour yet:</span>
<span class="i0">Consider, Jehane, which to take</span>
<span class="i0">Of life or death!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i8">So, scarce awake</span>
<span class="i0">Dismounting, did she leave that place,</span>
<span class="i0">And totter some yards: with her face</span>
<span class="i0">Turn'd upward to the sky she lay,</span>
<span class="i0">Her head on a wet heap of hay,</span>
<span class="i0">And fell asleep: and while she slept,</span>
<span class="i0">And did not dream, the minutes crept</span>
<span class="i0">Round to the twelve again; but she,</span>
<span class="i0">Being waked at last, sigh'd quietly,</span>
<span class="i0">And strangely childlike came, and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"I will not." Straightway Godmar's head,</span>
<span class="i0">As though it hung on strong wires, turn'd</span>
<span class="i0">Most sharply round, and his face burn'd.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">For Robert&mdash;both his eyes were dry,</span>
<span class="i0">He could not weep but gloomily</span>
<span class="i0">He seem'd to watch the rain; yea, too,</span>
<span class="i0">His lips were firm; he tried once more</span>
<span class="i0">To touch her lips; she reach'd out, sore</span>
<span class="i0">And vain desire so tortured them,</span>
<span class="i0">The poor grey lips, and now the hem</span>
<span class="i0">Of his sleeve brush'd them.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i8">With a start</span>
<span class="i0">Up Godmar rose, thrust them apart;</span>
<span class="i0">From Robert's throat he loosed the bands</span>
<span class="i0">Of silk and mail; with empty hands</span>
<span class="i0">Held out, she stood and gazed, and saw,</span>
<span class="i0">The long bright blade without a flaw</span>
<span class="i0">Glide out from Godmar's sheath, his hand</span>
<span class="i0">In Robert's hair; she saw him bend</span>
<span class="i0">Back Robert's head; she saw him send</span>
<span class="i0">The thin steel down; the blow told well,</span>
<span class="i0">Right backward the knight Robert fell,</span>
<span class="i0">And moan'd as dogs do, being half dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Unwitting, as I deem: so then</span>
<span class="i0">Godmar turn'd grinning to his men,</span>
<span class="i0">Who ran, some five or six, and beat</span>
<span class="i0">His head to pieces at their feet.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Godmar turn'd again and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"So, Jehane, the first fitte is read!</span>
<span class="i0">Take note, my lady, that your way</span>
<span class="i0">Lies backward to the Chatelet!"</span>
<span class="i0">She shook her head and gazed awhile</span>
<span class="i0">At her cold hands with a rueful smile,</span>
<span class="i0">As though this thing had made her mad.</span>
<span class="i0">This was the parting that they had</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the haystack in the floods.</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For many, many days together</span>
<span class="i2">The wind blew steady from the East;</span>
<span class="i0">For many days hot grew the weather,</span>
<span class="i2">About the time of our Lady's Feast.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">For many days we rode together,</span>
<span class="i2">Yet met we neither friend nor foe;</span>
<span class="i0">Hotter and clearer grew the weather,</span>
<span class="i2">Steadily did the East wind blow.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">We saw the trees in the hot, bright weather,</span>
<span class="i2">Clear-cut, with shadows very black,</span>
<span class="i0">As freely we rode on together</span>
<span class="i2">With helms unlaced and bridles slack.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And often as we rode together,</span>
<span class="i2">We, looking down the green-bank'd stream,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw flowers in the sunny weather,</span>
<span class="i2">And saw the bubble-making bream.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And in the night lay down together,</span>
<span class="i2">And hung above our heads the rood,</span>
<span class="i0">Or watch'd night-long in the dewy weather,</span>
<span class="i2">The while the moon did watch the wood.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Our spears stood bright and thick together,</span>
<span class="i2">Straight out the banners stream'd behind,</span>
<span class="i0">As we gallop'd on in the sunny weather,</span>
<span class="i2">With faces turn'd towards the wind.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Down sank our threescore spears together,</span>
<span class="i2">As thick we saw the Pagans ride;</span>
<span class="i0">His eager face in the clear fresh weather,</span>
<span class="i2">Shone out that last time by my side.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Up the sweep of the bridge we dash'd together,</span>
<span class="i2">It rock'd to the crash of the meeting spears,</span>
<span class="i0">Down rain'd the buds of the dear spring weather,</span>
<span class="i2">The elm-tree flowers fell like tears.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">There, as we roll'd and writhed together,</span>
<span class="i2">I threw my arms above my head,</span>
<span class="i0">For close by my side, in the lovely weather,</span>
<span class="i2">I saw him reel and fall back dead.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">I and the slayer met together,</span>
<span class="i2">He waited the death-stroke there in his place,</span>
<span class="i0">With thoughts of death, in the lovely weather,</span>
<span class="i2">Gapingly mazed at my madden'd face.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Madly I fought as we fought together;</span>
<span class="i2">In vain: the little Christian band</span>
<span class="i0">The pagans drowned, as in stormy weather,</span>
<span class="i2">The river drowns low-lying land.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">They bound my blood-stain'd hands together,</span>
<span class="i2">They bound his corpse to nod by my side:</span>
<span class="i0">Then on we rode, in the bright-March weather,</span>
<span class="i2">With clash of cymbals did we ride.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">We ride no more, no more together;</span>
<span class="i2">My prison-bars are thick and strong,</span>

<h3>BOOK XIV.</h3>

<h4><a name="THE_SIRENS" id="THE_SIRENS"></a>The Sirens&mdash;The Garden of the Hesperides
&mdash;The Heroes do Sacrifice at Malea.</h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Across the open sea they drew their wake</span>
<span class="i0">For three long days, and when the fourth 'gan break</span>
<span class="i0">Their eyes beheld the fair Trinacrian shore,</span>
<span class="i0">And there-along they coasted two days more.</span>
<span class="i0">Then first Medea warned them to take heed,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest they should end all memory of their deed</span>
<span class="i0">Where dwell the Sirens on the yellow sand,</span>
<span class="i0">And folk should think some tangled poisonous land</span>
<span class="i0">Had buried them, or some tumultuous sea</span>
<span class="i0">O'er their white bones was tossing angrily;</span>
<span class="i0">Or that some muddy river, far from Greece,</span>
<span class="i0">Drove seaward o'er the ringlets of the Fleece.</span>
<span class="i2">But when the Miny&aelig; hearkened to this word,</span>
<span class="i0">With many a thought their wearied hearts were stirred,</span>
<span class="i0">And longing for the near-gained Grecian land,</span>
<span class="i0">Where in a little while their feet should stand;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet none the less like to a happy dream,</span>
<span class="i0">Now, when they neared it, did their own home seem,</span>
<span class="i0">And like a dream the glory of their quest,</span>
<span class="i0">And therewithal some thought of present rest</span>
<span class="i0">Stole over them, and they were fain to sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Hearkening the sighing restless wind go by.</span>
<span class="i2">But hard on even of the second day,</span>
<span class="i0">As o'er the gentle waves they took their way,</span>
<span class="i0">The orange-scented land-breeze seemed to bear</span>
<span class="i0">Some other sounds unto the listening ear</span>
<span class="i0">Than all day long they had been hearkening,</span>
<span class="i0">The land-born signs of many a well-known thing.</span>
<span class="i0">Thereat Medea trembled, for she knew</span>
<span class="i0">That nigh the dreadful sands at last they drew,</span>
<span class="i0">For certainly the Sirens' song she heard,</span>
<span class="i0">Though yet her ear could shape it to no word,</span>
<span class="i0">And by their faces could the queen behold</span>
<span class="i0">How sweet it was, although no tale it told,</span>
<span class="i0">To those worn toilers o'er the bitter sea.</span>
<span class="i2">Now, as they sped along, they presently,</span>
<span class="i0">Rounding a headland, reached a little bay</span>
<span class="i0">Walled from the sea by splintered cliffs and grey,</span>
<span class="i0">Capped by the thymy hills' green wind-beat head,</span>
<span class="i0">Where 'mid the whin the burrowing rabbits fed.</span>
<span class="i0">And 'neath the cliff they saw a belt of sand,</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt Nereus' pasture and the high scarped land,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereon, yet far off, could their eyes behold</span>
<span class="i0">White bodies moving, crowned and girt with gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherefrom it seemed that lovely music welled.</span>
<span class="i2">So when all this the grey-eyed queen beheld,</span>
<span class="i0">She said: "O Jason, I have made thee wise</span>
<span class="i0">In this and other things; turn then thine eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Seaward, and note the ripple of the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Where there is hope as well as fear for thee.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor look upon the death that lurketh there</span>
<span class="i0">'Neath the grey cliff, though sweet it seems and fair;</span>
<span class="i0">For thou art young upon this day to die.</span>
<span class="i0">Take then the helm, and gazing steadily</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the road to Greece, make strong thine hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And steer us toward the lion-haunted land,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou, O Thracian! if thou e'er hast moved</span>
<span class="i0">Men's hearts with stories of the Gods who loved,</span>
<span class="i0">And men who suffered, move them on this day,</span>
<span class="i0">Taking the deadly love of death away,</span>
<span class="i0">That even now is stealing over them,</span>
<span class="i0">While still they gaze upon the ocean's hem,</span>
<span class="i0">Where their undoing is if they but knew."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But while she spake, still nigher Argo drew</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the yellow edges of the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">And little help she had of ashen oar,</span>
<span class="i0">For as her shielded side rolled through the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Silent with glittering eyes the Miny&aelig;</span>
<span class="i0">Gazed o'er the surge, for they were nigh enow</span>
<span class="i0">To see the gusty wind of evening blow</span>
<span class="i0">Long locks of hair across those bodies white,</span>
<span class="i0">With golden spray hiding some dear delight;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, nigh enow to see their red lips smile,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherefrom all song had ceased now for a while,</span>
<span class="i0">As though they deemed the prey was in the net,</span>
<span class="i0">And they no more had need a bait to set,</span>
<span class="i0">But their own bodies, fair beyond man's thought,</span>
<span class="i0">Under the grey cliff, hidden not of aught</span>
<span class="i0">But of such mist of tears as in the eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Of those seafaring men might chance to rise.</span>
<span class="i2">A moment Jason gazed, then through the waist</span>
<span class="i0">Ran swiftly, and with trembling hands made haste</span>
<span class="i0">To trim the sail, then to the tiller ran,</span>
<span class="i0">And thrust aside the skilled Milesian man,</span>
<span class="i0">Who with half-open mouth, and dreamy eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood steering Argo to that land of lies;</span>
<span class="i0">But as he staggered forward, Jason's hand</span>
<span class="i0">Hard on the tiller steered away from land,</span>
<span class="i0">And as her head a little now fell off</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the wide sea, did he shout this scoff</span>
<span class="i0">To Thracian Orpheus: "Minstrel, shall we die,</span>
<span class="i0">Because thou hast forgotten utterly</span>
<span class="i0">What things she taught thee whom men call divine?</span>
<span class="i0">Or will thy measures but lead folk to wine,</span>
<span class="i0">And scented beds, and not to noble deeds?</span>
<span class="i0">Or will they fail as fail the shepherd's reeds</span>
<span class="i0">Before the trumpet, when these sea-witches</span>
<span class="i0">Pipe shrilly to the washing of the seas?</span>
<span class="i0">I am a man, and these but beasts, but thou</span>
<span class="i0">Giving these souls, that all were men ere now,</span>
<span class="i0">Shalt be a very God and not a man!"</span>
<span class="i2">So spake he; but his fingers Orpheus ran</span>
<span class="i0">Over the strings, and sighing turned away</span>
<span class="i0">From that fair ending of the sunny bay;</span>
<span class="i0">But as his well-skilled hands were preluding</span>
<span class="i0">What his heart swelled with, they began to sing</span>
<span class="i0">With pleading voices from the yellow sands,</span>

<span class="i0">And yellow sand unto their eyes grew dim,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor did they see their fellow any more.</span>
<span class="i2">But when they once again beheld the shore</span>
<span class="i0">The wind sung o'er the empty beach and bare,</span>
<span class="i0">And by the cliff uprose into the air</span>
<span class="i0">A delicate and glittering little cloud,</span>
<span class="i0">That seemed some many-coloured sun to shroud;</span>
<span class="i0">But as the rugged cliff it drew above</span>
<span class="i0">The wondering Miny&aelig; beheld it move</span>
<span class="i0">Westward, toward Lilyb&aelig;um and the sun.</span>
<span class="i2">Then once more was their seaward course begun,</span>
<span class="i0">And soon those deadly sands were far astern,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever after could the heroes learn</span>
<span class="i0">If Butes lived or died; but old tales tell</span>
<span class="i0">That while the tumbling waves he breasted well,</span>
<span class="i0">Venus beheld him, as unseen she drew</span>
<span class="i0">From sunny Cyprus to the headland blue</span>
<span class="i0">Of Lilyb&aelig;um, where her temple is;</span>
<span class="i0">She, with a mind his sun-burnt brows to kiss,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as his feet were dropping nigh the beach,</span>
<span class="i0">And ere his hand the deadly hands could reach,</span>
<span class="i0">Stooped, as the merlin stoops upon the dove,</span>
<span class="i0">And snatched him thence to be awhile her love,</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the golden pillars of her shrine,</span>
<span class="i0">That those who pass the &AElig;gades see shine</span>
<span class="i0">From high-raised Lilyb&aelig;um o'er the sea.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But far away the sea-beat Miny&aelig;</span>
<span class="i0">Cast forth the foam, as through the growing night</span>
<span class="i0">They laboured ever, having small delight</span>
<span class="i0">In life all empty of that promised bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">In love that scarce can give a dying kiss,</span>
<span class="i0">In pleasure ending sweet songs with a wail,</span>
<span class="i0">In fame that little can dead men avail,</span>
<span class="i0">In vain toil struggling with the fateful stream,</span>
<span class="i0">In hope, the promise of a morning dream.</span>
<span class="i2">Yet as night died, and the cold sea and grey</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed running with them toward the dawn of day,</span>
<span class="i0">Needs must they once again forget their death,</span>
<span class="i0">Needs must they, being alive and drawing breath,</span>
<span class="i0">As men who of no other life can know</span>
<span class="i0">In their own minds again immortal grow.</span>
<span class="i2">But toward the south a little now they bent,</span>
<span class="i0">And for a while o'er landless sea they went,</span>
<span class="i0">But on the third day made another land</span>
<span class="i0">At dawn of day, and thitherward did stand;</span>
<span class="i0">And since the wind blew lightly from the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat abeam, they feared not with the oar</span>
<span class="i0">To push across the shallowing sea and green,</span>
<span class="i0">That washed a land the fairest they had seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose shell-strewn beach at highest of the tide</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt sea and flowery shore was nowise wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And drawn a little backward from the sea</span>
<span class="i0">There stood a marble wall wrought cunningly,</span>
<span class="i0">Rosy and white, set thick with images,</span>
<span class="i0">And over-topped with heavy-fruited trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Which by the shore ran, as the bay did bend,</span>
<span class="i0">And to their eyes had neither gap nor end;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor any gate: and looking over this,</span>
<span class="i0">They saw a place not made for earthly bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">Or eyes of dying men, for growing there</span>
<span class="i0">The yellow apple and the painted pear,</span>
<span class="i0">And well-filled golden cups of oranges</span>
<span class="i0">Hung amid groves of pointed cypress trees;</span>
<span class="i0">On grassy slopes the twining vine-boughs grew,</span>
<span class="i0">And hoary olives 'twixt far mountains blue,</span>
<span class="i0">And many-coloured flowers, like as a cloud</span>
<span class="i0">The rugged southern cliffs did softly shroud;</span>
<span class="i0">And many a green-necked bird sung to his mate</span>
<span class="i0">Within the slim-leaved, thorny pomegranate,</span>
<span class="i0">That flung its unstrung rubies on the grass,</span>
<span class="i0">And slowly o'er the place the wind did pass</span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with many odours that it bore</span>
<span class="i0">From thymy hills down to the sea-beat shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Because no flower there is, that all the year,</span>
<span class="i0">From spring to autumn, beareth otherwhere,</span>
<span class="i0">But there it flourished; nor the fruit alone</span>
<span class="i0">From 'twixt the green leaves and the boughs outshone,</span>
<span class="i0">For there each tree was ever flowering.</span>
<span class="i2">Nor was there lacking many a living thing</span>
<span class="i0">Changed of its nature; for the roebuck there</span>
<span class="i0">Walked fearless with the tiger; and the bear</span>
<span class="i0">Rolled sleepily upon the fruit-strawn grass,</span>
<span class="i0">Letting the conies o'er his rough hide pass,</span>
<span class="i0">With blinking eyes, that meant no treachery.</span>
<span class="i0">Careless the partridge passed the red fox by;</span>
<span class="i0">Untouched the serpent left the thrushes brown,</span>
<span class="i0">And as a picture was the lion's frown.</span>
<span class="i2">But in the midst there was a grassy space,</span>
<span class="i0">Raised somewhat over all the flowery place,</span>
<span class="i0">On marble terrace-walls wrought like a dream;</span>
<span class="i0">And round about it ran a clear blue stream,</span>
<span class="i0">Bridged o'er with marble steps, and midmost there</span>
<span class="i0">Grew a green tree, whose smooth grey boughs did bear</span>
<span class="i0">Such fruit as never man elsewhere had seen,</span>
<span class="i0">For 'twixt the sunlight and the shadow green</span>
<span class="i0">Shone out fair apples of red gleaming gold.</span>
<span class="i0">Moreover round the tree, in many a fold,</span>
<span class="i0">Lay coiled a dragon, glittering little less</span>
<span class="i0">Than that which his eternal watchfulness</span>
<span class="i0">Was set to guard; nor yet was he alone,</span>
<span class="i0">For from the daisied grass about him shone</span>
<span class="i0">Gold raiment wrapping round two damsels fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And one upon the steps combed out her hair,</span>
<span class="i0">And with shut eyes sung low as in a dream;</span>
<span class="i0">And one stood naked in the cold blue stream,</span>
<span class="i0">While on the bank her golden raiment lay;</span>
<span class="i0">But on that noontide of the quivering day,</span>
<span class="i0">She only, hearing the seafarers' shout,</span>
<span class="i0">Her lovely golden head had turned about,</span>
<span class="i0">And seen their white sail flapping o'er the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">And as she turned had let her tresses fall,</span>
<span class="i0">Which the thin water rippling round her knee</span>
<span class="i0">Bore outward from her toward the restless sea.</span>
<span class="i2">Not long she stood, but looking seaward yet,</span>
<span class="i0">From out the water made good haste to get,</span>
<span class="i0">And catching up her raiment hastily,</span>
<span class="i0">Ran up the marble stair, and 'gan to cry:</span>
<span class="i0">"Wake, O my sisters, wake, for now are come</span>
<span class="i0">The thieves of &AElig;a to our peaceful home."</span>
<span class="i2">Then at her voice they gat them to their feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And when her raiment all her body sweet</span>
<span class="i0">Once more had hidden, joining hand to hand,</span>
<span class="i0">About the sacred apples did they stand,</span>
<span class="i0">While coiled the dragon closer to the tree,</span>
<span class="i0">And raised his head above them threateningly.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, from Argo many a sea-beat face</span>
<span class="i0">Gazed longingly upon that lovely place,</span>
<span class="i0">And some their eager hands already laid</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the gangway. Then Medea said:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"Get back unto the oars, O Miny&aelig;,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor loiter here, for what have such as we</span>
<span class="i0">To do herein, where, 'mid undying trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Undying watch the wise Hesperides,</span>
<span class="i0">And where the while they watch, scarce can a God</span>
<span class="i0">Set foot upon the fruit-besprinkled sod</span>
<span class="i0">That no snow ever covers? therefore haste,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet in wondering your fair lives waste;</span>
<span class="i0">For these are as the Gods, nor think of us,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to their eyes can aught be glorious</span>
<span class="i0">That son of man can do; would God that I</span>
<span class="i0">Could see far off the misty headland lie,</span>
<span class="i0">Where we the guilt of blood shall wash away,</span>
<span class="i0">For I grow weary of the dashing spray,</span>
<span class="i0">And ceaseless roll of interwoven seas,</span>
<span class="i0">And fain were sitting 'neath the whispering trees</span>
<span class="i0">In homely places, where the children play,</span>
<span class="i0">Who change like me, grow old, and die some day."</span>
<span class="i2">She ceased, and little soothly did they grieve,</span>
<span class="i0">For all its loveliness, that land to leave,</span>
<span class="i0">For now some God had chilled their hardihead,</span>
<span class="i0">And in their hearts had set a sacred dread,</span>
<span class="i0">They knew not why; but on their oars they hung,</span>
<span class="i0">A little longer as the sisters sung.</span>

&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"O ye, who to this place have strayed,</span>
<span class="i0">That never for man's eyes was made,</span>
<span class="i0">Depart in haste, as ye have come,</span>
<span class="i0">And bear back to your sea-beat home</span>
<span class="i0">This memory of the age of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And for your eyes, grown over-bold,</span>
<span class="i0">Your hearts shall pay in sorrowing,</span>
<span class="i0">For want of many a half-seen thing.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Lo, such as is this garden green,</span>
<span class="i0">In days past, all the world has been,</span>
<span class="i0">And what we know all people knew,</span>
<span class="i0">Save this, that unto worse all grew.</span>
<span class="i2">"But since the golden age is gone,</span>
<span class="i0">This little place is left alone,</span>
<span class="i0">Unchanged, unchanging, watched of us,</span>
<span class="i0">The daughters of wise Hesperus.</span>
<span class="i2">"Surely the heavenly Messenger</span>
<span class="i0">Full oft is fain to enter here,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet without must he abide;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor longeth less the dark king's bride</span>
<span class="i0">To set red lips unto that fruit</span>
<span class="i0">That erst made nought her mother's suit.</span>
<span class="i0">Here would Diana rest awhile,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful of her woodland guile,</span>
<span class="i0">Among these beasts that fear her nought.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it less in Pallas' thought,</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath our trees to ponder o'er</span>
<span class="i0">The wide, unfathomed sea of lore;</span>
<span class="i0">And oft-kissed Cither&aelig;a, no less</span>
<span class="i0">Weary of love, full fain would press</span>
<span class="i0">These flowers with soft unsandalled feet.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"But unto us our rest is sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">Neither shall any man or God</span>
<span class="i0">Or lovely Goddess touch the sod</span>
<span class="i0">Where-under old times buried lie,</span>
<span class="i0">Before the world knew misery.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor will we have a slave or king,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet will we learn anything</span>
<span class="i0">But that we know, that makes us glad;</span>
<span class="i0">While oft the very Gods are sad</span>
<span class="i0">With knowing what the Fates shall do.</span>
<span class="i2">"Neither from us shall wisdom go</span>
<span class="i0">To fill the hungering hearts of men,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest to them threescore years and ten</span>
<span class="i0">Come but to seem a little day,</span>
<span class="i0">Once given, and taken soon away.</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, rather let them find their life</span>
<span class="i0">Bitter and sweet, fulfilled of strife,</span>
<span class="i0">Restless with hope, vain with regret,</span>
<span class="i0">Trembling with fear, most strangely set</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt memory and forgetfulness;</span>
<span class="i0">So more shall joy be, troubles less,</span>
<span class="i0">And surely when all this is past,</span>
<span class="i0">They shall not want their rest at last.</span>
<span class="i2">"Let earth and heaven go on their way,</span>
<span class="i0">While still we watch from day to day,</span>
<span class="i0">In this green place left all alone,</span>
<span class="i0">A remnant of the days long gone."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">There in the wind they hung, as word by word</span>
<span class="i0">The clear-voiced singers silently they heard;</span>
<span class="i0">But when the air was barren of their song,</span>
<span class="i0">Anigh the shore they durst not linger long,</span>
<span class="i0">So northward turned forewearied Argo's head,</span>
<span class="i0">And dipping oars, from that fair country sped,</span>
<span class="i0">Fulfilled of new desires and pensive thought,</span>
<span class="i0">Which that day's life unto their hearts had brought.</span>
<span class="i2">Then hard they toiled upon the bitter sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And in two days they did not fail to be</span>
<span class="i0">In sight of land, a headland high and blue</span>
<span class="i0">Which straight Milesian Erginus knew</span>
<span class="i0">To be the fateful place which now they sought,</span>
<span class="i0">Stormy Malea, so thitherward they brought</span>
<span class="i0">The groaning ship, and, casting anchor, lay</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath that headland's lee, within a bay,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherefrom the more part landed, and their feet</span>
<span class="i0">Once more the happy soil of Greece did meet.</span>
<span class="i2">Therewith they fail&egrave;d not to bring ashore</span>
<span class="i0">Rich robes of price and of fair arms good store,</span>
<span class="i0">And gold and silver, that they there might buy</span>
<span class="i0">What yet they lacked for their solemnity;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, while upon the highest point of land</span>
<span class="i0">Some built an altar, Jason, with a band</span>
<span class="i0">Of all the chiefest of the Miny&aelig;,</span>
<span class="i0">Turned inland from the murmur of the sea.</span>
<span class="i2">Not far they went ere by a little stream</span>
<span class="i0">Down in a valley they could see the gleam</span>
<span class="i0">Of brazen pillars and fair-gilded vanes,</span>
<span class="i0">And, dropping down by dank dark-wooded lanes</span>
<span class="i0">From off the hill-side, reached a house at last</span>
<span class="i0">Where in and out men-slaves and women passed,</span>
<span class="i0">And guests were streaming fast into the hall,</span>
<span class="i0">Where now the oaken boards were laid for all.</span>
<span class="i0">With these the Miny&aelig; went, and soon they were</span>
<span class="i0">Within a pillared hall both great and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Where folk already sat beside the board,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the dais was an ancient lord.</span>
<span class="i2">But when these saw the fearless Miny&aelig;</span>
<span class="i0">Glittering in arms, they sprang up hastily,</span>
<span class="i0">And each man turned about unto the wall</span>
<span class="i0">To seize his spear or staff: then through the hall</span>
<span class="i0">Jason cried out: "Laconians, fear ye not,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor leave the flesh-meat while it reeketh hot</span>
<span class="i0">For dread of us, for we are men as ye,</span>
<span class="i0">And I am Jason of the Miny&aelig;,</span>
<span class="i0">And come from &AElig;a to the land of Greece,</span>
<span class="i0">And in my ship bear back the Golden Fleece,</span>
<span class="i0">And a fair Colchian queen to fill my bed.</span>
<span class="i0">And now we pray to share your wine and bread,</span>
<span class="i0">And other things we need, and at our hands</span>
<span class="i0">That ye will take fair things of many lands."</span>
<span class="i2">"Sirs," said the ancient lord, "be welcome here,</span>
<span class="i0">Come up and sit by me, and make such cheer</span>
<span class="i0">As here ye can: glad am I that to me</span>
<span class="i0">The first of Grecian men from off the sea</span>
<span class="i0">Ye now are come."</span>
<span class="i8">Therewith the great hall rang</span>
<span class="i0">With joyful shouts, and as, with clash and clang</span>
<span class="i0">Of well-wrought arms, up to the dais they went,</span>
<span class="i0">All eyes upon the Miny&aelig; were bent,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor could they have enough of wondering</span>
<span class="i0">At this or that sea-tossed victorious king.</span>
<span class="i2">So with the strangers there they held high feast,</span>
<span class="i0">And afterwards the slaves drove many a beast</span>
<span class="i0">Down to the shore, and carried back again</span>
<span class="i0">Great store of precious things in pack and wain;</span>
<span class="i0">Wrought gold and silver, gems, full many a bale</span>
<span class="i0">Of scarlet cloth, and fine silk, fit to veil</span>
<span class="i0">The perfect limbs of dreaded Goddesses;</span>
<span class="i0">Spices fresh-gathered from the outland trees,</span>
<span class="i0">And arms well-wrought, and precious scarce-known wine,</span>
<span class="i0">And carven images well-nigh divine.</span>
<span class="i2">So when all folk with these were satisfied,</span>
<span class="i0">Back went the Miny&aelig; to the water-side,</span>
<span class="i0">And with them that old lord, fain to behold</span>
<span class="i0">Victorious Argo and the Fleece of Gold.</span>
<span class="i0">And so aboard amid the oars he lay</span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the night, and at the dawn of day</span>
<span class="i0">Did all men land, nor spared that day to wear</span>
<span class="i0">The best of all they had of gold-wrought gear,</span>
<span class="i0">And every one, being crowned with olive grey,</span>
<span class="i0">Up to the headland did they take their way,</span>
<span class="i0">Where now already stood the crown&egrave;d priests</span>
<span class="i0">About the altars by the gilt-horned beasts.</span>
<span class="i0">There, as the fair sun rose, did Jason break</span>
<span class="i0">Over the altar the thin barley-cake,</span>
<span class="i0">And cast the salt abroad, and there were slain</span>
<span class="i0">The milk-white bulls, and there red wine did rain</span>
<span class="i0">On to the fire from out the ancient jar,</span>
<span class="i0">And high rose up the red flame, seen afar</span>
<span class="i0">From many another headland of that shore:</span>
<span class="i0">But over all its crackling and its roar</span>
<span class="i0">Uprose from time to time a joyous song,</span>
<span class="i0">That on the summer morning lay for long,</span>
<span class="i0">The mighty voices of the Miny&aelig;</span>
<span class="i0">Exulting o'er the tossing conquered sea,</span>
<span class="i0">That far below thrust on by tide and wind</span>
<span class="i0">The crumbling bases of the headland mined.</span>

<p>Certain gentlemen and mariners of Norway, having considered all that
they had heard of the Earthly Paradise, set sail to find it, and after
many troubles and the lapse of many years came old men to some Western
land, of which they had never before heard: there they died, when they
had dwelt there certain years, much honoured of the strange people.</p>

<span class="i0">White as the changing walls of fa&euml;rie,</span>
<span class="i0">Thronged with much people clad in ancient guise</span>
<span class="i0">I now am fain to set before your eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">There, leave the clear green water and the quays,</span>
<span class="i0">And pass betwixt its marble palaces,</span>
<span class="i0">Until ye come unto the chiefest square;</span>
<span class="i0">A bubbling conduit is set midmost there,</span>
<span class="i0">And round about it now the maidens throng,</span>
<span class="i0">With jest and laughter, and sweet broken song,</span>
<span class="i0">Making but light of labour new begun</span>
<span class="i0">While in their vessels gleams the morning sun.</span>
<span class="i2">On one side of the square a temple stands,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein the gods worshipped in ancient lands</span>
<span class="i0">Still have their altars, a great market-place</span>
<span class="i0">Upon two other sides fills all the space,</span>
<span class="i0">And thence the busy hum of men comes forth;</span>
<span class="i0">But on the cold side looking toward the north</span>
<span class="i0">A pillared council-house may you behold,</span>
<span class="i0">Within whose porch are images of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Gods of the nations who dwelt anciently</span>
<span class="i0">About the borders of the Grecian sea.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Pass now between them, push the brazen door,</span>
<span class="i0">And standing on the polished marble floor</span>
<span class="i0">Leave all the noises of the square behind;</span>
<span class="i0">Most calm that reverent chamber shall ye find,</span>
<span class="i0">Silent at first, but for the noise you made</span>
<span class="i0">When on the brazen door your hand you laid</span>
<span class="i0">To shut it after you&mdash;but now behold</span>
<span class="i0">The city rulers on their thrones of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Clad in most fair attire, and in their hands</span>
<span class="i0">Long carven silver-banded ebony wands;</span>
<span class="i0">Then from the da&iuml;s drop your eyes and see</span>
<span class="i0">Soldiers and peasants standing reverently</span>
<span class="i0">Before those elders, round a little band</span>
<span class="i0">Who bear such arms as guard the English land,</span>
<span class="i0">But battered, rent, and rusted sore, and they,</span>
<span class="i0">The men themselves, are shrivelled, bent, and grey;</span>
<span class="i0">And as they lean with pain upon their spears</span>
<span class="i0">Their brows seem furrowed deep with more than years;</span>
<span class="i0">For sorrow dulls their heavy sunken eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Bent are they less with time than miseries.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Pondering on them the city grey-beards gaze</span>
<span class="i0">Through kindly eyes, midst thoughts of other days,</span>
<span class="i0">And pity for poor souls, and vague regret</span>
<span class="i0">For all the things that might have happened yet,</span>
<span class="i0">Until, their wonder gathering to a head,</span>
<span class="i0">The wisest man, who long that land has led,</span>
<span class="i0">Breaks the deep silence, unto whom again</span>
<span class="i0">A wanderer answers. Slowly as in pain,</span>
<span class="i0">And with a hollow voice as from a tomb</span>
<span class="i0">At first he tells the story of his doom,</span>
<span class="i0">But as it grows and once more hopes and fears,</span>
<span class="i0">Both measureless, are ringing round his ears,</span>
<span class="i0">His eyes grow bright, his seeming days decrease,</span>
<span class="i0">For grief once told brings somewhat back of peace.</span>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Wanderer.</span></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Masters, I have to tell a tale of woe,</span>
<span class="i0">A tale of folly and of wasted life,</span>
<span class="i0">Hope against hope, the bitter dregs of strife,</span>
<span class="i0">Ending, where all things end, in death at last:</span>
<span class="i0">So if I tell the story of the past,</span>
<span class="i0">Let it be worth some little rest, I pray,</span>
<span class="i0">A little slumber ere the end of day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">No wonder if the Grecian tongue I know,</span>
<span class="i0">Since at Byzantium many a year ago</span>
<span class="i0">My father bore the twibil valiantly;</span>
<span class="i0">There did he marry, and get me, and die,</span>
<span class="i0">And I went back to Norway to my kin,</span>
<span class="i0">Long ere this beard ye see did first begin</span>
<span class="i0">To shade my mouth, but nathless not before</span>
<span class="i0">Among the Greeks I gathered some small lore,</span>
<span class="i0">And standing midst the V&aelig;ringers, still heard</span>
<span class="i0">From this or that man many a wondrous word;</span>
<span class="i0">For ye shall know that though we worshipped God,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard mass duly, still of Swithiod</span>
<span class="i0">The Greater, Odin and his house of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">The noble stories ceased not to be told;</span>
<span class="i0">These moved me more than words of mine can say</span>
<span class="i0">E'en while at Micklegarth my folks did stay;</span>
<span class="i0">But when I reached one dying autumn-tide</span>
<span class="i0">My uncle's dwelling near the forest side,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw the land so scanty and so bare,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the hard things men contend with there,</span>
<span class="i0">A little and unworthy land it seemed,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet the more of Asagard I dreamed,</span>
<span class="i0">And worthier seemed the ancient faith of praise.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But now, but now&mdash;when one of all those days</span>
<span class="i0">Like Lazarus' finger on my heart should be</span>
<span class="i0">Breaking the fiery fixed eternity,</span>
<span class="i0">But for one moment&mdash;could I see once more</span>
<span class="i0">The grey-roofed sea-port sloping towards the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Or note the brown boats standing in from sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the great dromond swinging from the quay,</span>
<span class="i0">Or in the beech-woods watch the screaming jay</span>
<span class="i0">Shoot up betwixt the tall trunks, smooth and grey&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, could I see the days before distress</span>
<span class="i0">When very longing was but happiness.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Within our house there was a Breton squire</span>
<span class="i0">Well learned, who fail'd not to fan the fire</span>
<span class="i0">That evermore unholpen burned in me</span>
<span class="i0">Strange lands and things beyond belief to see;</span>
<span class="i0">Much lore of many lands this Breton knew;</span>
<span class="i0">And for one tale I told, he told me two.</span>
<span class="i0">He, counting Asagard a new-told thing,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet spoke of gardens ever blossoming</span>
<span class="i0">Across the western sea where none grew old,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as the books at Micklegarth had told,</span>
<span class="i0">And said moreover that an English knight</span>
<span class="i0">Had had the Earthly Paradise in sight,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard the songs of those that dwelt therein.</span>
<span class="i0">But entered not, being hindered by his sin.</span>
<span class="i0">Shortly, so much of this and that he said</span>
<span class="i0">That in my heart the sharp barb entered,</span>
<span class="i0">And like real life would empty stories seem,</span>
<span class="i0">And life from day to day an empty dream.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Another man there was, a Swabian priest,</span>
<span class="i0">Who knew the maladies of man and beast,</span>
<span class="i0">And what things helped them; he the stone still sought</span>
<span class="i0">Whereby base metal into gold is brought,</span>
<span class="i0">And strove to gain the precious draught, whereby</span>
<span class="i0">Men live midst mortal men yet never die;</span>
<span class="i0">Tales of the Kaiser Redbeard could he tell</span>
<span class="i0">Who neither went to Heaven nor yet to Hell,</span>
<span class="i0">When from that fight upon the Asian plain</span>
<span class="i0">He vanished, but still lives to come again</span>
<span class="i0">Men know not how or when; but I listening</span>
<span class="i0">Unto this tale thought it a certain thing</span>
<span class="i0">That in some hidden vale of Swithiod</span>
<span class="i0">Across the golden pavement still he trod.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But while our longing for such things so grew,</span>
<span class="i0">And ever more and more we deemed them true,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the land a pestilence there fell</span>
<span class="i0">Unheard of yet in any chronicle,</span>
<span class="i0">And, as the people died full fast of it,</span>
<span class="i0">With these two men it chanced me once to sit,</span>
<span class="i0">This learned squire whose name was Nicholas,</span>
<span class="i0">And Swabian Laurence, as our manner was;</span>
<span class="i0">For could we help it scarcely did we part</span>
<span class="i0">From dawn to dusk: so heavy, sad at heart,</span>
<span class="i0">We from the castle-yard beheld the bay</span>
<span class="i0">Upon that ne'er-to-be-forgotten day,</span>
<span class="i0">Little we said amidst that dreary mood,</span>
<span class="i0">And certes nought that we could say was good.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">It was a bright September afternoon,</span>
<span class="i0">The parched-up beech-trees would be yellowing soon</span>
<span class="i0">The yellow flowers grown deeper with the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Were letting fall their petals one by one;</span>
<span class="i0">No wind there was, a haze was gathering o'er</span>
<span class="i0">The furthest bound of the faint yellow shore;</span>
<span class="i0">And in the oily waters of the bay</span>
<span class="i0">Scarce moving aught some fisher-cobles lay,</span>
<span class="i0">And all seemed peace; and had been peace indeed</span>
<span class="i0">But that we young men of our life had need,</span>
<span class="i0">And to our listening ears a sound was borne</span>
<span class="i0">That made the sunlight wretched and forlorn&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;The heavy tolling of the minster bell&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And nigher yet a tinkling sound did tell</span>
<span class="i0">That through the streets they bore our Saviour Christ</span>
<span class="i0">By dying lips in anguish to be kissed.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">At last spoke Nicholas, "How long shall we</span>
<span class="i0">Abide here, looking forth into the sea</span>
<span class="i0">Expecting when our turn shall come to die?</span>
<span class="i0">Fair fellows, will ye come with me and try</span>
<span class="i0">Now at our worst that long-desired quest,</span>
<span class="i0">Now&mdash;when our worst is death, and life our best."</span>
<span class="i2">"Nay, but thou know'st," I said, "that I but wait</span>
<span class="i0">The coming of some man, the turn of fate,</span>
<span class="i0">To make this voyage&mdash;but I die meanwhile,</span>
<span class="i0">For I am poor, though my blood be not vile,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet for all his lore doth Laurence hold</span>
<span class="i0">Within his crucibles aught like to gold;</span>
<span class="i0">And what hast thou, whose father driven forth</span>
<span class="i0">By Charles of Blois, found shelter in the North?</span>
<span class="i0">But little riches as I needs must deem."</span>
<span class="i2">"Well," said he, "things are better than they seem,</span>
<span class="i0">For 'neath my bed an iron chest I have</span>
<span class="i0">That holdeth things I have made shift to save</span>
<span class="i0">E'en for this end; moreover, hark to this,</span>
<span class="i0">In the next firth a fair long ship there is</span>
<span class="i0">Well victualled, ready even now for sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And I may say it 'longeth unto me;</span>
<span class="i0">Since Marcus Erling, late its owner, lies</span>
<span class="i0">Dead at the end of many miseries,</span>
<span class="i0">And little Kirstin, as thou well mayst know,</span>
<span class="i0">Would be content throughout the world to go</span>
<span class="i0">If I but took her hand, and now still more</span>
<span class="i0">Hath heart to leave this poor death-stricken shore.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore my gold shall buy us Bordeaux swords</span>
<span class="i0">And Bordeaux wine as we go oceanwards.</span>
<span class="i2">"What say ye, will ye go with me to-night,</span>
<span class="i0">Setting your faces to undreamed delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Turning your backs unto this troublous hell,</span>
<span class="i0">Or is the time too short to say farewell?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Not so," I said, "rather would I depart</span>
<span class="i0">Now while thou speakest, never has my heart</span>
<span class="i0">Been set on anything within this land."</span>
<span class="i2">Then said the Swabian, "Let us now take hand</span>
<span class="i0">And swear to follow evermore this quest</span>
<span class="i0">Till death or life have set our hearts at rest."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So with joined hands we swore, and Nicholas said,</span>
<span class="i0">"To-night, fair friends, be ye apparelled</span>
<span class="i0">To leave this land, bring all the arms ye can</span>
<span class="i0">And such men as ye trust, my own good man</span>
<span class="i0">Guards the small postern looking towards St. Bride,</span>
<span class="i0">And good it were ye should not be espied,</span>
<span class="i0">Since mayhap freely ye should not go hence,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou Rolf in special, for this pestilence</span>
<span class="i0">Makes all men hard and cruel, nor are they</span>
<span class="i0">Willing that folk should 'scape if they must stay:</span>
<span class="i0">Be wise; I bid you for a while farewell,</span>
<span class="i0">Leave ye this stronghold when St. Peter's bell</span>
<span class="i0">Strikes midnight, all will surely then be still,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will bide you at King Tryggve's hill</span>
<span class="i0">Outside the city gates."</span>
<span class="i8">Each went his way</span>
<span class="i0">Therewith, and I the remnant of that day</span>
<span class="i0">Gained for the quest three men that I deemed true,</span>
<span class="i0">And did such other things as I must do,</span>
<span class="i0">And still was ever listening for the chime</span>
<span class="i0">Half maddened by the lazy lapse of time,</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, scarce I thought indeed that I should live</span>
<span class="i0">Till the great tower the joyful sound should give</span>
<span class="i0">That set us free: and so the hours went past,</span>
<span class="i0">Till startled by the echoing clang at last</span>
<span class="i0">That told of midnight, armed from head to heel</span>
<span class="i0">Down to the open postern did I steal,</span>
<span class="i0">Bearing small wealth&mdash;this sword that yet hangs here</span>
<span class="i0">Worn thin and narrow with so many a year,</span>
<span class="i0">My father's axe that from Byzantium,</span>
<span class="i0">With some few gems my pouch yet held, had come,</span>
<span class="i0">Nought else that shone with silver or with gold.</span>
<span class="i2">But by the postern gate could I behold</span>
<span class="i0">Laurence the priest all armed as if for war,</span>
<span class="i0">From off the town-wall, having some small store</span>
<span class="i0">Of arms and furs and raiment: then once more</span>
<span class="i0">I turned, and saw the autumn moonlight fall</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the new-built bastions of the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">Strange with black shadow and grey flood of light,</span>
<span class="i0">And further off I saw the lead shine bright</span>
<span class="i0">On tower and turret-roof against the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">And looking down I saw the old town lie</span>
<span class="i0">Black in the shade of the o'er-hanging hill,</span>
<span class="i0">Stricken with death, and dreary, but all still</span>
<span class="i0">Until it reached the water of the bay,</span>
<span class="i0">That in the dead night smote against the quay</span>
<span class="i0">Not all unheard, though there was little wind.</span>
<span class="i0">But as I turned to leave the place behind,</span>
<span class="i0">The wind's light sound, the slowly falling swell,</span>
<span class="i0">Were hushed at once by that shrill-tinkling bell,</span>
<span class="i0">That in that stillness jarring on mine ears,</span>
<span class="i0">With sudden jangle checked the rising tears,</span>
<span class="i0">And now the freshness of the open sea</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed ease and joy and very life to me.</span>
<span class="i2">So greeting my new mates with little sound,</span>
<span class="i0">We made good haste to reach King Tryggve's mound,</span>
<span class="i0">And there the Breton Nicholas beheld,</span>
<span class="i0">Who by the hand fair Kirstin Erling held,</span>
<span class="i0">And round about them twenty men there stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Of whom the more part on the holy rood</span>
<span class="i0">Were sworn till death to follow up the quest,</span>
<span class="i0">And Kirstin was the mistress of the rest.</span>
<span class="i2">Again betwixt us was there little speech,</span>
<span class="i0">But swiftly did we set on toward the beach,</span>
<span class="i0">And coming there our keel, the Fighting Man,</span>
<span class="i0">We boarded, and the long oars out we ran,</span>
<span class="i0">And swept from out the firth, and sped so well</span>
<span class="i0">That scarcely could we hear St. Peter's bell</span>
<span class="i0">Toll one, although the light wind blew from land;</span>
<span class="i0">Then hoisting sail southward we 'gan to stand,</span>
<span class="i0">And much I joyed beneath the moon to see</span>
<span class="i0">The lessening land that might have been to me</span>
<span class="i0">A kindly giver of wife, child, and friend,</span>
<span class="i0">And happy life, or at the worser end</span>
<span class="i0">A quiet grave till doomsday rend the earth.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Night passed, day dawned, and we grew full of mirth</span>
<span class="i0">As with the ever-rising morning wind</span>
<span class="i0">Still further lay our threatened death behind,</span>
<span class="i0">Or so we thought: some eighty men we were,</span>
<span class="i0">Of whom but fifty knew the shipman's gear,</span>
<span class="i0">The rest were uplanders; midst such of these</span>
<span class="i0">As knew not of our quest, with promises</span>
<span class="i0">Went Nicholas dealing florins round about,</span>
<span class="i0">With still a fresh tale for each new man's doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">Till all were fairly won or seemed to be</span>
<span class="i0">To that strange desperate voyage o'er the sea.</span>

<h2><a name="OGIER_THE_DANE" id="OGIER_THE_DANE"></a>OGIER THE DANE.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p>When Ogier was born, six fay ladies came to the cradle where he lay, and
gave him various gifts, as to be brave and happy and the like; but the
sixth gave him to be her love when he should have lived long in the
world: so Ogier grew up and became the greatest of knights, and at last,
after many years, fell into the hands of that fay, and with her, as the
story tells, he lives now, though he returned once to the world, as is
shown in the process of this tale.</p>


<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within some Danish city by the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose name, changed now, is all unknown to me,</span>
<span class="i0">Great mourning was there one fair summer eve,</span>
<span class="i0">Because the angels, bidden to receive</span>
<span class="i0">The fair Queen's lovely soul in Paradise,</span>
<span class="i0">Had done their bidding, and in royal guise</span>
<span class="i0">Her helpless body, once the prize of love,</span>
<span class="i0">Unable now for fear or hope to move,</span>
<span class="i0">Lay underneath the golden canopy;</span>
<span class="i0">And bowed down by unkingly misery</span>
<span class="i0">The King sat by it, and not far away,</span>
<span class="i0">Within the chamber a fair man-child lay,</span>
<span class="i0">His mother's bane, the king that was to be,</span>
<span class="i0">Not witting yet of any royalty,</span>
<span class="i0">Harmless and loved, although so new to life.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Calm the June evening was, no sign of strife</span>
<span class="i0">The clear sky showed, no storm grew round the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy that his day of bliss was done;</span>
<span class="i0">Dumb was the sea, and if the beech-wood stirred,</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas with the nestling of the grey-winged bird</span>
<span class="i0">Midst its thick leaves; and though the nightingale</span>
<span class="i0">Her ancient, hapless sorrow must bewail,</span>
<span class="i0">No more of woe there seemed in her song</span>
<span class="i0">Than such as doth to lovers' words belong,</span>
<span class="i0">Because their love is still unsatisfied.</span>
<span class="i2">But to the King, on that sweet eventide,</span>
<span class="i0">No earth there seemed, no heaven when earth was gone;</span>
<span class="i0">No help, no God! but lonely pain alone;</span>
<span class="i0">And he, midst unreal shadows, seemed to sit</span>
<span class="i0">Himself the very heart and soul of it.</span>
<span class="i0">But round the cradle of the new-born child</span>
<span class="i0">The nurses now the weary time beguiled</span>
<span class="i0">With stories of the just departed Queen;</span>
<span class="i0">And how, amid the heathen folk first seen,</span>
<span class="i0">She had been won to love and godliness;</span>
<span class="i0">And as they spoke, e'en midst his dull distress,</span>
<span class="i0">An eager whisper now and then would smite</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the King's ear, of some past delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Some once familiar name, and he would raise</span>
<span class="i0">His weary head, and on the speaker gaze</span>
<span class="i0">Like one about to speak, but soon again</span>
<span class="i0">Would drop his head and be alone with pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor think of these; who, silent in their turn,</span>
<span class="i0">Would sit and watch the waxen tapers burn</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the dusk of the quick-gathering night,</span>
<span class="i0">Until beneath the high stars' glimmering light,</span>
<span class="i0">The fresh earth lay in colourless repose.</span>
<span class="i2">So passed the night, and now and then one rose</span>
<span class="i0">From out her place to do what might avail</span>
<span class="i0">To still the new-born infant's fretful wail;</span>
<span class="i0">Or through the softly-opened door there came</span>
<span class="i0">Some nurse new waked, who, whispering low the name</span>
<span class="i0">Of her whose turn was come, would take her place;</span>
<span class="i0">Then toward the King would turn about her face</span>
<span class="i0">And to her fellows whisper of the day,</span>
<span class="i0">And tell again of her just past away.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So passed the night, the moon arose and grew,</span>
<span class="i0">From off the sea a little west-wind blew,</span>
<span class="i0">Rustling the garden-leaves like sudden rain;</span>
<span class="i0">And ere the moon had 'gun to fall again</span>
<span class="i0">The wind grew cold, a change was in the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">And in deep silence did the dawn draw nigh;</span>
<span class="i0">Then from her place a nurse arose to light</span>
<span class="i0">Fresh hallowed lights, for, dying with the night,</span>
<span class="i0">The tapers round about the dead Queen were;</span>
<span class="i0">But the King raised his head and 'gan to stare</span>
<span class="i0">Upon her, as her sweeping gown did glide</span>
<span class="i0">About the floor, that in the stillness cried</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath her careful feet; and now as she</span>
<span class="i0">Had lit the second candle carefully,</span>
<span class="i0">And on its silver spike another one</span>
<span class="i0">Was setting, through her body did there run</span>
<span class="i0">A sudden tremor, and the hand was stayed</span>
<span class="i0">That on the dainty painted wax was laid;</span>
<span class="i0">Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the staring King began to creep</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet slumber too; the bitter lines of woe</span>
<span class="i0">That drew his weary face did softer grow,</span>
<span class="i0">His eyelids dropped, his arms fell to his side;</span>
<span class="i0">And moveless in their places did abide</span>
<span class="i0">The nursing women, held by some strong spell,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as they were, and utter silence fell</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the mournful, glimmering chamber fair.</span>
<span class="i2">But now light footsteps coming up the stair,</span>
<span class="i0">Smote on the deadly stillness, and the sound</span>
<span class="i0">Of silken dresses trailing o'er the ground;</span>
<span class="i0">And heavenly odours through the chamber passed,</span>
<span class="i0">Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the freshness of the dying night;</span>
<span class="i0">Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light</span>
<span class="i0">Until the door swung open noiselessly&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A mass of sunlit flowers there seemed to be</span>
<span class="i0">Within the doorway, and but pale and wan</span>
<span class="i0">The flame showed now that serveth mortal man,</span>
<span class="i0">As one by one six seeming ladies passed</span>
<span class="i0">Into the room, and o'er its sorrow cast</span>
<span class="i0">That thoughtless sense of joy bewildering,</span>
<span class="i0">That kisses youthful hearts amidst of spring;</span>
<span class="i0">Crowned were they, in such glorious raiment clad,</span>
<span class="i0">As yet no merchant of the world has had</span>
<span class="i0">Within his coffers; yet those crowns seemed fair</span>
<span class="i0">Only because they kissed their odorous hair,</span>
<span class="i0">And all that flowery raiment was but blessed</span>
<span class="i0">By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed.</span>
<span class="i2">Now to the cradle from that glorious band,</span>
<span class="i0">A woman passed, and laid a tender hand</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the babe, and gently drew aside</span>
<span class="i0">The swathings soft that did his body hide;</span>
<span class="i0">And, seeing him so fair and great, she smiled,</span>
<span class="i0">And stooped, and kissed him, saying, "O noble child,</span>
<span class="i0">Have thou a gift from Gloriande this day;</span>
<span class="i0">For to the time when life shall pass away</span>
<span class="i0">From this dear heart, no fear of death or shame,</span>
<span class="i0">No weariness of good shall foul thy name."</span>
<span class="i2">So saying, to her sisters she returned;</span>
<span class="i0">And one came forth, upon whose brow there burned</span>
<span class="i0">A crown of rubies, and whose heaving breast</span>
<span class="i0">With happy rings a golden hauberk pressed;</span>
<span class="i0">She took the babe, and somewhat frowning said,</span>
<span class="i0">"This gift I give, that till thy limbs are laid</span>
<span class="i0">At rest for ever, to thine honoured life</span>
<span class="i0">There never shall be lacking war and strife,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou a long-enduring name mayst win,</span>
<span class="i0">And by thy deeds, good pardon for thy sin."</span>
<span class="i2">With that another, who, unseen, meanwhile</span>
<span class="i0">Had drawn anigh, said with a joyous smile,</span>
<span class="i0">"And this forgotten gift to thee I give,</span>
<span class="i0">That while amidst the turmoil thou dost live,</span>
<span class="i0">Still shalt thou win the game, and unto thee</span>
<span class="i0">Defeat and shame but idle words shall be."</span>
<span class="i2">Then back they turned, and therewithal, the fourth</span>
<span class="i0">Said, "Take this gift for what it may be worth</span>
<span class="i0">For that is mine to give; lo, thou shalt be</span>
<span class="i0">Gentle of speech, and in all courtesy</span>
<span class="i0">The first of men: a little gift this is,</span>
<span class="i0">After these promises of fame and bliss."</span>
<span class="i2">Then toward the babe the fifth fair woman went;</span>
<span class="i0">Grey-eyed she was, and simple, with eyes bent</span>
<span class="i0">Down on the floor, parted her red lips were,</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er her sweet face marvellously fair</span>
<span class="i0">Oft would the colour spread full suddenly;</span>
<span class="i0">Clad in a dainty gown and thin was she,</span>
<span class="i0">For some green summer of the fay-land dight,</span>
<span class="i0">Tripping she went, and laid her fingers light</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the child, and said, "O little one,</span>
<span class="i0">As long as thou shalt look upon the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Shall women long for thee; take heed to this</span>
<span class="i0">And give them what thou canst of love and bliss."</span>
<span class="i2">Then, blushing for her words, therefrom she past,</span>
<span class="i0">And by the cradle stood the sixth and last,</span>
<span class="i0">The fairest of them all; awhile she gazed</span>
<span class="i0">Down on the child, and then her hand she raised,</span>
<span class="i0">And made the one side of her bosom bare;</span>
<span class="i0">"Ogier," she said, "if this be foul or fair</span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st not now, but when thine earthly life</span>
<span class="i0">Is drunk out to the dregs, and war and strife</span>
<span class="i0">Have yielded thee whatever joy they may,</span>
<span class="i0">Thine head upon this bosom shalt thou lay;</span>
<span class="i0">And then, despite of knowledge or of God,</span>
<span class="i0">Will we be glad upon the flowery sod</span>
<span class="i0">Within the happy country where I dwell:</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier, my love that is to be, farewell!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">She turned, and even as they came they passed</span>
<span class="i0">From out the place, and reached the gate at last</span>
<span class="i0">That oped before their feet, and speedily</span>
<span class="i0">They gained the edges of the murmuring sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And as they stood in silence, gazing there</span>
<span class="i0">Out to the west, they vanished into air,</span>
<span class="i0">I know not how, nor whereto they returned.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But mixed with twilight in the chamber burned</span>
<span class="i0">The flickering candles, and those dreary folk,</span>
<span class="i0">Unlike to sleepers, from their trance awoke,</span>
<span class="i0">But nought of what had happed meanwhile they knew.</span>
<span class="i0">Through the half-opened casements now there blew</span>
<span class="i0">A sweet fresh air, that of the flowers and sea</span>
<span class="i0">Mingled together, smelt deliciously,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the unseen sun the spreading light</span>
<span class="i0">Began to make the fair June blossoms bright,</span>
<span class="i0">And midst their weary woe uprose the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus has Ogier's noble life begun.</span>

<span class="i0">Hope is our life, when first our life grows clear;</span>
<span class="i0">Hope and delight, scarce crossed by lines of fear,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet the day comes when fain we would not hope,</span>
<span class="i0">But forasmuch as we with life must cope,</span>
<span class="i0">Struggling with this and that, and who knows why?</span>
<span class="i0">Hope will not give us up to certainty,</span>
<span class="i0">But still must bide with us: and with this man,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose life amid such promises began</span>
<span class="i0">Great things she wrought; but now the time has come</span>
<span class="i0">When he no more on earth may have his home.</span>
<span class="i2">Great things he suffered, great delights he had,</span>
<span class="i0">Unto great kings he gave good deeds for bad;</span>
<span class="i0">He ruled o'er kingdoms where his name no more</span>
<span class="i0">Is had in memory, and on many a shore</span>
<span class="i0">He left his sweat and blood to win a name</span>
<span class="i0">Passing the bounds of earthly creatures' fame.</span>
<span class="i0">A love he won and lost, a well-loved son</span>
<span class="i0">Whose little day of promise soon was done:</span>
<span class="i0">A tender wife he had, that he must leave</span>
<span class="i0">Before his heart her love could well receive;</span>
<span class="i0">Those promised gifts, that on his careless head</span>
<span class="i0">In those first hours of his fair life were shed</span>
<span class="i0">He took unwitting, and unwitting spent,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor gave himself to grief and discontent</span>
<span class="i0">Because he saw the end a-drawing nigh.</span>
<span class="i2">Where is he now? in what land must he die,</span>
<span class="i0">To leave an empty name to us on earth?</span>
<span class="i0">A tale half true, to cast across our mirth</span>
<span class="i0">Some pensive thoughts of life that might have been;</span>
<span class="i0">Where is he now, that all this life has seen?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Behold, another eve I bid you see</span>
<span class="i0">Than that calm eve of his nativity;</span>
<span class="i0">The sun is setting in the west, the sky</span>
<span class="i0">Is clear and hard, and no clouds come anigh</span>
<span class="i0">The golden orb, but further off they lie,</span>
<span class="i0">Steel-grey and black with edges red as blood,</span>
<span class="i0">And underneath them is the weltering flood</span>
<span class="i0">Of some huge sea, whose tumbling hills, as they</span>
<span class="i0">Turn restless sides about, are black or grey,</span>
<span class="i0">Or green, or glittering with the golden flame;</span>
<span class="i0">The wind has fallen now, but still the same</span>
<span class="i0">The mighty army moves, as if to drown</span>
<span class="i0">This lone, bare rock, whose shear scarped sides of brown</span>
<span class="i0">Cast off the weight of waves in clouds of spray.</span>
<span class="i2">Alas! what ships upon an evil day</span>
<span class="i0">Bent over to the wind in this ill sea?</span>
<span class="i0">What navy, whose rent bones lie wretchedly</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath these cliffs? a mighty one it was,</span>
<span class="i0">A fearful storm to bring such things to pass.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">This is the loadstone rock; no armament</span>
<span class="i0">Of warring nations, in their madness bent</span>
<span class="i0">Their course this way; no merchant wittingly</span>
<span class="i0">Has steered his keel unto this luckless sea;</span>
<span class="i0">Upon no shipman's card its name is writ,</span>
<span class="i0">Though worn-out mariners will speak of it</span>
<span class="i0">Within the ingle on the winter's night,</span>
<span class="i0">When all within is warm and safe and bright,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wind howls without: but 'gainst their will</span>
<span class="i0">Are some folk driven here, and then all skill</span>
<span class="i0">Against this evil rock is vain and nought,</span>
<span class="i0">And unto death the shipmen soon are brought;</span>
<span class="i0">For then the keel, as by a giant's hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Is drawn unto that mockery of a land,</span>
<span class="i0">And presently unto its sides doth cleave;</span>
<span class="i0">When if they 'scape swift death, yet none may leave</span>
<span class="i0">The narrow limits of that barren isle,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus are slain by famine in a while</span>
<span class="i0">Mocked, as they say, by night with images</span>
<span class="i0">Of noble castles among groves of trees,</span>
<span class="i0">By day with sounds of merry minstrelsy.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">The sun sinks now below this hopeless sea,</span>
<span class="i0">The clouds are gone, and all the sky is bright;</span>
<span class="i0">The moon is rising o'er the growing night,</span>
<span class="i0">And by its light may ye behold the bones</span>
<span class="i0">Of generations of these luckless ones</span>
<span class="i0">Scattered about the rock; but nigh the sea</span>
<span class="i0">Sits one alive, who uncomplainingly</span>
<span class="i0">Awaits his death. White-haired is he and old,</span>
<span class="i0">Arrayed in royal raiment, bright with gold,</span>
<span class="i0">But tarnished with the waves and rough salt air;</span>
<span class="i0">Huge is he, of a noble face and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">As for an ancient man, though toil and eld</span>
<span class="i0">Furrow the cheeks that ladies once beheld</span>
<span class="i0">With melting hearts&mdash;Nay, listen, for he speaks!</span>
<span class="i2">"God, thou hast made me strong! nigh seven weeks</span>
<span class="i0">Have passed since from the wreck we haled our store,</span>
<span class="i0">And five long days well told, have now passed o'er</span>
<span class="i0">Since my last fellow died, with my last bread</span>
<span class="i0">Between his teeth, and yet I am not dead.</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, but for this I had been strong enow</span>
<span class="i0">In some last bloody field my sword to show.</span>
<span class="i0">What matter? soon will all be past and done,</span>
<span class="i0">Where'er I died I must have died alone:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, Caraheu, a good death had it been</span>
<span class="i0">Dying, thy face above me to have seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard my banner flapping in the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">Then, though my memory had not left thy mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet hope and fear would not have vexed thee more</span>
<span class="i0">When thou hadst known that everything was o'er;</span>
<span class="i0">But now thou waitest, still expecting me,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose sail shall never speck thy bright blue sea.</span>
<span class="i2">"And thou, Clarice, the merchants thou mayst call,</span>
<span class="i0">To tell thee tales within thy pictured hall,</span>
<span class="i0">But never shall they tell true tales of me:</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever sails the Kentish hills may see</span>
<span class="i0">Swept by the flood-tide toward thy well-walled town,</span>
<span class="i0">No more on my sails shall they look adown.</span>
<span class="i2">"Get thee another leader, Charlemaine,</span>
<span class="i0">For thou shalt look to see my shield in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">When in the fair fields of the Frankish land,</span>
<span class="i0">Thick as the corn they tread, the heathen stand.</span>
<span class="i2">"What matter? ye shall learn to live your lives;</span>
<span class="i0">Husbands and children, other friends and wives,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall wipe the tablets of your memory clean,</span>
<span class="i0">And all shall be as I had never been.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"And now, O God, am I alone with Thee;</span>
<span class="i0">A little thing indeed it seems to be</span>
<span class="i0">To give this life up, since it needs must go</span>
<span class="i0">Some time or other; now at last I know</span>
<span class="i0">How foolishly men play upon the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">When unto them a year of life seems worth</span>
<span class="i0">Honour and friends, and these vague hopes and sweet</span>
<span class="i0">That like real things my dying heart do greet,</span>
<span class="i0">Unreal while living on the earth I trod,</span>
<span class="i0">And but myself I knew no other god.</span>
<span class="i0">Behold, I thank Thee that Thou sweet'nest thus</span>
<span class="i0">This end, that I had thought most piteous,</span>
<span class="i0">If of another I had heard it told."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">What man is this, who weak and worn and old,</span>
<span class="i0">Gives up his life within that dreadful isle,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the fearful coming death can smile?</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! this man, so battered and outworn,</span>
<span class="i0">Is none but he, who, on that summer morn,</span>
<span class="i0">Received such promises of glorious life:</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier the Dane this is, to whom all strife</span>
<span class="i0">Was but as wine to stir awhile the blood,</span>
<span class="i0">To whom all life, however hard, was good:</span>
<span class="i0">This is the man, unmatched of heart and limb,</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier the Dane, whose sight has waxed not dim</span>
<span class="i0">For all the years that he on earth has dwelt;</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier the Dane, that never fear has felt,</span>
<span class="i0">Since he knew good from ill; Ogier the Dane,</span>
<span class="i0">The heathen's dread, the evil-doer's bane.</span>

<span class="i0"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Bright</span> had the moon grown as his words were done,</span>
<span class="i0">And no more was there memory of the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Within the west, and he grew drowsy now,</span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat smoother was his wrinkled brow</span>
<span class="i0">As thought died out beneath the hand of sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er his soul forgetfulness did creep,</span>
<span class="i0">Hiding the image of swift-coming death;</span>
<span class="i0">Until as peacefully he drew his breath</span>
<span class="i0">As on that day, past for a hundred years,</span>
<span class="i0">When, midst the nurse's quickly-falling tears,</span>
<span class="i0">He fell asleep to his first lullaby.</span>
<span class="i2">The night changed as he slept, white clouds and high</span>
<span class="i0">Began about the lonely moon to close;</span>
<span class="i0">And from the dark west a new wind arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And with the sound of heavy-falling waves</span>
<span class="i0">Mingled its pipe about the loadstone caves;</span>
<span class="i0">But when the twinkling stars were hid away,</span>
<span class="i0">And a faint light and broad, like dawn of day,</span>
<span class="i0">The moon upon that dreary country shed,</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier awoke, and lifting up his head</span>
<span class="i0">And smiling, muttered, "Nay, no more again;</span>
<span class="i0">Rather some pleasure new, some other pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Unthought of both, some other form of strife;"</span>
<span class="i0">For he had waked from dreams of his old life,</span>
<span class="i0">And through St. Omer's archer-guarded gate</span>
<span class="i0">Once more had seemed to pass, and saw the state</span>
<span class="i0">Of that triumphant king; and still, though all</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed changed, and folk by other names did call</span>
<span class="i0">Faces he knew of old, yet none the less</span>
<span class="i0">He seemed the same, and, midst that mightiness,</span>
<span class="i0">Felt his own power, and grew the more athirst</span>
<span class="i0">For coming glory, as of old, when first</span>
<span class="i0">He stood before the face of Charlemaine,</span>
<span class="i0">A helpless hostage with all life to gain.</span>
<span class="i2">But now, awake, his worn face once more sank</span>
<span class="i0">Between his hands, and, murmuring not, he drank</span>
<span class="i0">The draught of death that must that thirst allay.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But while he sat and waited for the day</span>
<span class="i0">A sudden light across the bare rock streamed,</span>
<span class="i0">Which at the first he noted not, but deemed</span>
<span class="i0">The moon her fleecy veil had broken through;</span>
<span class="i0">But ruddier indeed this new light grew</span>
<span class="i0">Than were the moon's grey beams, and, therewithal,</span>
<span class="i0">Soft far-off music on his ears did fall;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet moved he not, but murmured, "This is death,</span>
<span class="i0">An easy thing like this to yield my breath,</span>
<span class="i0">Awake, yet dreaming, with no sounds of fear,</span>
<span class="i0">No dreadful sights to tell me it is near;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, God, I thank Thee!" but with that last word</span>
<span class="i0">It seemed to him that he his own name heard</span>
<span class="i0">Whispered, as though the wind had borne it past;</span>
<span class="i0">With that he gat unto his feet at last,</span>
<span class="i0">But still awhile he stood, with sunken head,</span>
<span class="i0">And in a low and trembling voice he said,</span>
<span class="i0">"Lord, I am ready, whither shall I go?</span>
<span class="i0">I pray Thee unto me some token show."</span>
<span class="i0">And, as he said this, round about he turned,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the east beheld a light that burned</span>
<span class="i0">As bright as day; then, though his flesh might fear</span>
<span class="i0">The coming change that he believed so near,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet did his soul rejoice, for now he thought</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the very heaven to be brought:</span>
<span class="i0">And though he felt alive, deemed it might be</span>
<span class="i0">That he in sleep had died full easily.</span>
<span class="i2">Then toward that light did he begin to go,</span>
<span class="i0">And still those strains he heard, far off and low,</span>
<span class="i0">That grew no louder; still that bright light streamed</span>
<span class="i0">Over the rocks, yet nothing brighter seemed,</span>
<span class="i0">But like the light of some unseen bright flame</span>
<span class="i0">Shone round about, until at last he came</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the dreary islet's other shore,</span>
<span class="i0">And then the minstrelsy he heard no more,</span>
<span class="i0">And softer seemed the strange light unto him;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet or ever it had grown quite dim,</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath its waning light could he behold</span>
<span class="i0">A mighty palace set about with gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Above green meads and groves of summer trees</span>
<span class="i0">Far-off across the welter of the seas;</span>
<span class="i0">But, as he gazed, it faded from his sight,</span>
<span class="i0">And the grey hidden moon's diffused soft light,</span>
<span class="i0">Which soothly was but darkness to him now,</span>
<span class="i0">His sea-girt island prison did but show.</span>
<span class="i2">But o'er the sea he still gazed wistfully,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Alas! and when will this go by</span>
<span class="i0">And leave my soul in peace? must I still dream</span>
<span class="i0">Of life that once so dear a thing did seem,</span>
<span class="i0">That, when I wake, death may the bitterer be?</span>
<span class="i0">Here will I sit until he come to me,</span>
<span class="i0">And hide mine eyes and think upon my sin,</span>
<span class="i0">That so a little calm I yet may win</span>
<span class="i0">Before I stand within the awful place."</span>
<span class="i2">Then down he sat and covered up his face,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet therewithal his trouble could not hide,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor waiting thus for death could he abide,</span>
<span class="i0">For, though he knew it not, the yearning pain</span>
<span class="i0">Of hope of life had touched his soul again&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">If he could live awhile, if he could live!</span>
<span class="i0">The mighty being, who once was wont to give</span>
<span class="i0">The gift of life to many a trembling man;</span>
<span class="i0">Who did his own will since his life began;</span>
<span class="i0">Who feared not aught, but strong and great and free</span>
<span class="i0">Still cast aside the thought of what might be;</span>
<span class="i0">Must all this then be lost, and with no will,</span>
<span class="i0">Powerless and blind, must he some fate fulfil,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor know what he is doing any more?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Soon he arose and paced along the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">And gazed out seaward for the blessed light;</span>
<span class="i0">But nought he saw except the old sad sight,</span>
<span class="i0">The ceaseless tumbling of the billows grey,</span>
<span class="i0">The white upspringing of the spurts of spray</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst that mass of timbers, the rent bones</span>
<span class="i0">Of the sea-houses of the hapless ones</span>
<span class="i0">Once cast like him upon this deadly isle.</span>
<span class="i2">He stopped his pacing in a little while,</span>
<span class="i0">And clenched his mighty hands, and set his teeth,</span>
<span class="i0">And gazing at the ruin underneath,</span>
<span class="i0">He swung from off the bare cliff's jagged brow,</span>
<span class="i0">And on some slippery ledge he wavered now,</span>
<span class="i0">Without a hand-hold, and now stoutly clung</span>
<span class="i0">With hands alone, and o'er the welter hung,</span>
<span class="i0">Not caring aught if thus his life should end;</span>
<span class="i0">But safely midst all this did he descend</span>
<span class="i0">The dreadful cliff, and since no beach was there,</span>
<span class="i0">But from the depths the rock rose stark and bare,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor crumbled aught beneath the hammering sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the wrecks he stood unsteadily.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But now, amid the clamour of the waves,</span>
<span class="i0">And washing to-and-fro of beams and staves,</span>
<span class="i0">Dizzy with hunger, dreamy with distress,</span>
<span class="i0">And all those days of fear and loneliness,</span>
<span class="i0">The ocean's tumult seemed the battle's roar,</span>
<span class="i0">His heart grew hot, as when in days of yore</span>
<span class="i0">He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd</span>
<span class="i0">Of dusky faces; now he shouted loud,</span>
<span class="i0">And from crushed beam to beam began to leap,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet his footing somehow did he keep</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst their tossing, and indeed the sea</span>
<span class="i0">Was somewhat sunk upon the island's lee.</span>
<span class="i0">So quickly on from wreck to wreck he passed,</span>
<span class="i0">And reached the outer line of wrecks at last,</span>
<span class="i0">And there a moment stood unsteadily,</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the drift of spray that hurried by,</span>
<span class="i0">And drew Courtain his sword from out its sheath,</span>
<span class="i0">And poised himself to meet the coming death,</span>
<span class="i0">Still looking out to sea; but as he gazed,</span>
<span class="i0">And once or twice his doubtful feet he raised</span>
<span class="i0">To take the final plunge, that heavenly strain</span>
<span class="i0">Over the washing waves he heard again,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the dimness something bright he saw</span>
<span class="i0">Across the waste of waters towards him draw;</span>
<span class="i0">And hidden now, now raised aloft, at last</span>
<span class="i0">Unto his very feet a boat was cast,</span>
<span class="i0">Gilded inside and out, and well arrayed</span>
<span class="i0">With cushions soft; far fitter to have weighed</span>
<span class="i0">From some sweet garden on the shallow Seine,</span>
<span class="i0">Or in a reach of green Thames to have lain,</span>
<span class="i0">Than struggle with that huge confus&egrave;d sea;</span>
<span class="i0">But Ogier gazed upon it doubtfully</span>
<span class="i0">One moment, and then, sheathing Courtain, said,</span>
<span class="i0">"What tales are these about the newly dead</span>
<span class="i0">The heathen told? what matter, let all pass;</span>
<span class="i0">This moment as one dead indeed I was,</span>
<span class="i0">And this must be what I have got to do,</span>
<span class="i0">I yet perchance may light on something new</span>
<span class="i0">Before I die; though yet perchance this keel</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the wondrous mass of charmed steel</span>
<span class="i0">Is drawn as others." With that word he leapt</span>
<span class="i0">Into the boat, and o'er the cushions crept</span>
<span class="i0">From stem to stern, but found no rudder there,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor any oars, nor were the cushions fair</span>
<span class="i0">Made wet by any dashing of the sea.</span>
<span class="i2">Now while he pondered how these things could be,</span>
<span class="i0">The boat began to move therefrom at last,</span>
<span class="i0">But over him a drowsiness was cast,</span>
<span class="i0">And as o'er tumbling hills the skiff did pass,</span>
<span class="i0">He clean forgot his death and where he was.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">At last he woke up to a sunny day,</span>
<span class="i0">And, looking round, saw that his shallop lay</span>
<span class="i0">Moored at the edge of some fair tideless sea</span>
<span class="i0">Unto an overhanging thick-leaved tree,</span>
<span class="i0">Where in the green waves did the low bank dip</span>
<span class="i0">Its fresh and green grass-covered daisied lip;</span>
<span class="i0">But Ogier looking thence no more could see</span>
<span class="i0">That sad abode of death and misery,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught but wide and empty ocean, grey</span>
<span class="i0">With gathering haze, for now it neared midday;</span>
<span class="i0">Then from the golden cushions did he rise,</span>
<span class="i0">And wondering still if this were Paradise</span>
<span class="i0">He stepped ashore, but drew Courtain his sword</span>
<span class="i0">And muttered therewithal a holy word.</span>
<span class="i2">Fair was the place, as though amidst of May,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the brown birds fear the sunny day,</span>
<span class="i0">For with their quivering song the air was sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">Thick grew the field-flowers underneath his feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And on his head the blossoms down did rain,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet mid these fair things slowly and with pain</span>
<span class="i0">He 'gan to go, yea, even when his foot</span>
<span class="i0">First touched the flowery sod, to his heart's root</span>
<span class="i0">A coldness seemed to strike, and now each limb</span>
<span class="i0">Was growing stiff, his eyes waxed bleared and dim,</span>
<span class="i0">And all his stored-up memory 'gan to fail,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet would his once mighty heart avail</span>
<span class="i0">For lamentations o'er his changed lot;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet urged by some desire, he knew not what,</span>
<span class="i0">Along a little path 'twixt hedges sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">Drawn sword in hand, he dragged his faltering feet,</span>
<span class="i0">For what then seemed to him a weary way,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereon his steps he needs must often stay</span>
<span class="i0">And lean upon the mighty well-worn sword</span>
<span class="i0">That in those hands, grown old, for king or lord</span>
<span class="i0">Had small respect in glorious days long past.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But still he crept along, and at the last</span>
<span class="i0">Came to a gilded wicket, and through this</span>
<span class="i0">Entered a garden fit for utmost bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">If that might last which needs must soon go by:</span>
<span class="i0">There 'gainst a tree he leaned, and with a sigh</span>
<span class="i0">He said, "O God, a sinner I have been,</span>
<span class="i0">And good it is that I these things have seen</span>
<span class="i0">Before I meet what Thou hast set apart</span>
<span class="i0">To cleanse the earthly folly from my heart;</span>
<span class="i0">But who within this garden now can dwell</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein guilt first upon the world befell?"</span>
<span class="i2">A little further yet he staggered on,</span>
<span class="i0">Till to a fountain-side at last he won,</span>
<span class="i0">O'er which two white-thorns their sweet blossoms shed,</span>
<span class="i0">There he sank down, and laid his weary head</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the mossy roots, and in a while</span>
<span class="i0">He slept, and dreamed himself within the isle;</span>
<span class="i0">That splashing fount the weary sea did seem,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his dream the fair place but a dream;</span>
<span class="i0">But when again to feebleness he woke</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his ears that heavenly music broke,</span>
<span class="i0">Not faint or far as in the isle it was,</span>
<span class="i0">But e'en as though the minstrels now did pass</span>
<span class="i0">Anigh his resting-place; then fallen in doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as he might, he rose and gazed about,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaning against the hawthorn stem with pain;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet his straining gaze was but in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">Death stole so fast upon him, and no more</span>
<span class="i0">Could he behold the blossoms as before,</span>
<span class="i0">No more the trees seemed rooted to the ground,</span>
<span class="i0">A heavy mist seemed gathering all around,</span>
<span class="i0">And in its heart some bright thing seemed to be,</span>
<span class="i0">And round his head there breathed deliciously</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet odours, and that music never ceased.</span>
<span class="i0">But as the weight of Death's strong hand increased</span>
<span class="i0">Again he sank adown, and Courtain's noise</span>
<span class="i0">Within the scabbard seemed a farewell voice</span>
<span class="i0">Sent from the world he loved so well of old,</span>
<span class="i0">And all his life was as a story told,</span>
<span class="i0">And as he thought thereof he 'gan to smile</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as a child asleep, but in a while</span>
<span class="i0">It was as though he slept, and sleeping dreamed,</span>
<span class="i0">For in his half-closed eyes a glory gleamed,</span>
<span class="i0">As though from some sweet face and golden hair,</span>
<span class="i0">And on his breast were laid soft hands and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And a sweet voice was ringing in his ears,</span>
<span class="i0">Broken as if with flow of joyous tears;</span>
<span class="i2">"Ogier, sweet friend, hast thou not tarried long?</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! thine hundred years of strife and wrong!"</span>
<span class="i0">Then he found voice to say, "Alas! dear Lord,</span>
<span class="i0">Too long, too long; and yet one little word</span>
<span class="i0">Right many a year agone had brought me here."</span>
<span class="i0">Then to his face that face was drawn anear,</span>
<span class="i0">He felt his head raised up and gently laid</span>
<span class="i0">On some kind knee, again the sweet voice said,</span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, Ogier, nay, not yet, not yet, dear friend!</span>
<span class="i0">Who knoweth when our linked life shall end,</span>
<span class="i0">Since thou art come unto mine arms at last,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the turmoil of the world is past?</span>
<span class="i0">Why do I linger ere I see thy face</span>
<span class="i0">As I desired it in that mourning place</span>
<span class="i0">So many years ago&mdash;so many years,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou knewest not thy love and all her fears?"</span>
<span class="i2">"Alas!" he said, "what mockery is this</span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt speak to me of earthly bliss?</span>
<span class="i0">No longer can I think upon the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">Have I not done with all its grief and mirth?</span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I was Ogier once, but if my love</span>
<span class="i0">Should come once more my dying heart to move,</span>
<span class="i0">Then must she come from 'neath the milk-white walls</span>
<span class="i0">Whereon to-day the hawthorn blossom falls</span>
<span class="i0">Outside St. Omer's&mdash;art thou she? her name</span>
<span class="i0">I could remember once mid death and fame</span>
<span class="i0">Is clean forgotten now; but yesterday,</span>
<span class="i0">Meseems, our son, upon her bosom lay:</span>
<span class="i0">Baldwin the fair&mdash;what hast thou done with him</span>
<span class="i0">Since Charlot slew him? Ah, mine eyes wax dim;</span>
<span class="i0">Woman, forbear! wilt thou not let me die?</span>
<span class="i0">Did I forget thee in the days gone by?</span>
<span class="i0">Then let me die, that we may meet again!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">He tried to move from her, but all in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">For life had well-nigh left him, but withal</span>
<span class="i0">He felt a kiss upon his forehead fall,</span>
<span class="i0">And could not speak; he felt slim fingers fair</span>
<span class="i0">Move to his mighty sword-worn hand, and there</span>
<span class="i0">Set on some ring, and still he could not speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And once more sleep weighed down his eyelids weak.</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, ah! what land was this he woke unto?</span>
<span class="i0">What joy was this that filled his heart anew?</span>
<span class="i0">Had he then gained the very Paradise?</span>
<span class="i0">Trembling, he durst not at the first arise,</span>
<span class="i0">Although no more he felt the pain of eld,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor durst he raise his eyes that now beheld</span>
<span class="i0">Beside him the white flowers and blades of grass;</span>
<span class="i0">He durst not speak, lest he some monster was.</span>
<span class="i2">But while he lay and hoped, that gentle voice</span>
<span class="i0">Once more he heard; "Yea, thou mayst well rejoice!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou livest still, my sweet, thou livest still,</span>
<span class="i0">Apart from every earthly fear and ill;</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou not love me, who have wrought thee this,</span>
<span class="i0">That I like thee may live in double bliss?"</span>
<span class="i2">Then Ogier rose up, nowise like to one</span>
<span class="i0">Whose span of earthly life is nigh outrun,</span>
<span class="i0">But as he might have risen in old days</span>
<span class="i0">To see the spears cleave the fresh morning haze;</span>
<span class="i0">But, looking round, he saw no change there was</span>
<span class="i0">In the fair place wherethrough he first did pass,</span>
<span class="i0">Though all, grown clear and joyous to his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Now looked no worse than very Paradise;</span>
<span class="i0">Behind him were the thorns, the fountain fair</span>
<span class="i0">Still sent its glittering stream forth into air,</span>
<span class="i0">And by its basin a fair woman stood,</span>
<span class="i0">And as their eyes met his renew&egrave;d blood</span>
<span class="i0">Rushed to his face; with unused thoughts and sweet</span>
<span class="i0">And hurrying hopes, his heart began to beat.</span>
<span class="i2">The fairest of all creatures did she seem;</span>
<span class="i0">So fresh and delicate you well might deem</span>
<span class="i0">That scarce for eighteen summers had she blessed</span>
<span class="i0">The happy, longing world; yet, for the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt</span>
<span class="i0">A child before her had the wise man felt,</span>
<span class="i0">And with the pleasure of a thousand years</span>
<span class="i0">Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears</span>
<span class="i0">Among the longing folk where she might dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">To give at last the kiss unspeakable.</span>
<span class="i2">In such wise was she clad as folk may be,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, for no shame of their humanity,</span>
<span class="i0">For no sad changes of the imperfect year,</span>
<span class="i0">Rather for added beauty, raiment wear;</span>
<span class="i0">For, as the heat-foretelling grey-blue haze</span>
<span class="i0">Veils the green flowery morn of late May-days,</span>
<span class="i0">Her raiment veiled her; where the bands did meet</span>
<span class="i0">That bound the sandals to her dainty feet,</span>
<span class="i0">Gems gleamed; a fresh rose-wreath embraced her head,</span>
<span class="i0">And on her breast there lay a ruby red.</span>
<span class="i2">So with a supplicating look she turned</span>
<span class="i0">To meet the flame that in his own eyes burned,</span>
<span class="i0">And held out both her white arms lovingly,</span>
<span class="i0">As though to greet him as he drew anigh.</span>
<span class="i0">Stammering he said, "Who art thou? how am I</span>
<span class="i0">So cured of all my evils suddenly,</span>
<span class="i0">That certainly I felt no mightier, when,</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the backward rush of beaten men,</span>
<span class="i0">About me drooped the axe-torn Oriflamme?</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! I fear that in some dream I am."</span>
<span class="i2">"Ogier," she said, "draw near, perchance it is</span>
<span class="i0">That such a name God gives unto our bliss;</span>
<span class="i0">I know not, but if thou art such an one</span>
<span class="i0">As I must deem, all days beneath the sun</span>
<span class="i0">That thou hast had, shall be but dreams indeed</span>
<span class="i0">To those that I have given thee at thy need.</span>
<span class="i0">For many years ago beside the sea</span>
<span class="i0">When thou wert born, I plighted troth with thee:</span>
<span class="i0">Come near then, and make mirrors of mine eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou mayest see what these my mysteries</span>
<span class="i0">Have wrought in thee; surely but thirty years,</span>
<span class="i0">Passed amidst joy, thy new born body bears,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor while thou art with me, and on this shore</span>
<span class="i0">Art still full-fed of love, shalt thou seem more.</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, love, come nigher, and let me take thine hand,</span>
<span class="i0">The hope and fear of many a warring land,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will show thee wherein lies the spell,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereby this happy change upon thee fell."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Like a shy youth before some royal love,</span>
<span class="i0">Close up to that fair woman did he move,</span>
<span class="i0">And their hands met; yet to his changed voice</span>
<span class="i0">He dared not trust; nay, scarcely could rejoice</span>
<span class="i0">E'en when her balmy breath he 'gan to feel,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt strange sweetness o'er his spirit steal</span>
<span class="i0">As her light raiment, driven by the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">Swept round him, and, bewildered and half-blind,</span>
<span class="i0">His lips the treasure of her lips did press,</span>
<span class="i0">And round him clung her perfect loveliness.</span>
<span class="i2">For one sweet moment thus they stood, and then</span>
<span class="i0">She drew herself from out his arms again,</span>
<span class="i0">And panting, lovelier for her love, did stand</span>
<span class="i0">Apart awhile, then took her lover's hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And, in a trembling voice, made haste to say,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">"O Ogier, when thou earnest here to-day,</span>
<span class="i0">I feared indeed, that in my sport with fate,</span>
<span class="i0">I might have seen thee e'en one day too late,</span>
<span class="i0">Before this ring thy finger should embrace;</span>
<span class="i0">Behold it, love, and thy keen eyes may trace</span>
<span class="i0">Faint figures wrought upon the ruddy gold;</span>
<span class="i0">My father dying gave it me, nor told</span>
<span class="i0">The manner of its making, but I know</span>
<span class="i0">That it can make thee e'en as thou art now</span>
<span class="i0">Despite the laws of God&mdash;shrink not from me</span>
<span class="i0">Because I give an impious gift to thee&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Has not God made me also, who do this?</span>
<span class="i0">But I, who longed to share with thee my bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">Am of the fays, and live their changeless life,</span>
<span class="i0">And, like the gods of old, I see the strife</span>
<span class="i0">That moves the world, unmoved if so I will;</span>
<span class="i0">For we the fruit, that teaches good and ill,</span>
<span class="i0">Have never touched like you of Adam's race;</span>
<span class="i0">And while thou dwellest with me in this place</span>
<span class="i0">Thus shalt thou be&mdash;ah, and thou deem'st, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou shalt gain thereby no happy meed</span>
<span class="i0">Reft of the world's joys? nor canst understand</span>
<span class="i0">How thou art come into a happy land?&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Love, in thy world the priests of heaven still sing,</span>
<span class="i0">And tell thee of it many a joyous thing;</span>
<span class="i0">But think'st thou, bearing the world's joy and pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou couldst live there? nay, nay, but born again</span>
<span class="i0">Thus wouldst be happy with the angels' bliss;</span>
<span class="i0">And so with us no otherwise it is,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor hast thou cast thine old life quite away</span>
<span class="i0">Even as yet, though that shall be to-day.</span>
<span class="i2">"But for the love and country thou hast won,</span>
<span class="i0">Know thou, that thou art come to Avallon,</span>
<span class="i0">That is both thine and mine; and as for me,</span>
<span class="i0">Morgan le Fay men call me commonly</span>
<span class="i0">Within the world, but fairer names than this</span>
<span class="i0">I have for thee and me, 'twixt kiss and kiss."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Ah, what was this? and was it all in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">That she had brought him here this life to gain?</span>
<span class="i0">For, ere her speech was done, like one turned blind</span>
<span class="i0">He watched the kisses of the wandering wind</span>
<span class="i0">Within her raiment, or as some one sees</span>
<span class="i0">The very best of well-wrought images</span>
<span class="i0">When he is blind with grief, did he behold</span>
<span class="i0">The wandering tresses of her locks of gold</span>
<span class="i0">Upon her shoulders; and no more he pressed</span>
<span class="i0">The hand that in his own hand lay at rest:</span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, grown dull with changing memories,</span>
<span class="i0">Could make no answer to her glorious eyes:</span>
<span class="i0">Cold waxed his heart, and weary and distraught,</span>
<span class="i0">With many a cast-by, hateful, dreary thought,</span>
<span class="i0">Unfinished in the old days; and withal</span>
<span class="i0">He needs must think of what might chance to fall</span>
<span class="i0">In this life new-begun; and good and bad</span>
<span class="i0">Tormented him, because as yet he had</span>
<span class="i0">A worldly heart within his frame made new,</span>
<span class="i0">And to the deeds that he was wont to do</span>
<span class="i0">Did his desires still turn. But she a while</span>
<span class="i0">Stood gazing at him with a doubtful smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And let his hand fall down; but suddenly</span>
<span class="i0">Sounded sweet music from some close nearby,</span>
<span class="i0">And then she spoke again: "Come, love, with me,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou thy new life and delights mayst see."</span>
<span class="i0">And gently with that word she led him thence,</span>
<span class="i0">And though upon him now there fell a sense</span>
<span class="i0">Of dreamy and unreal bewilderment,</span>
<span class="i0">As hand in hand through that green place they went,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet therewithal a strain of tender love</span>
<span class="i0">A little yet his restless heart did move.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So through the whispering trees they came at last</span>
<span class="i0">To where a wondrous house a shadow cast</span>
<span class="i0">Across the flowers, and o'er the daisied grass</span>
<span class="i0">Before it, crowds of lovely folk did pass,</span>
<span class="i0">Playing about in carelessness and mirth,</span>
<span class="i0">Unshadowed by the doubtful deeds of earth;</span>
<span class="i0">And from the midst a band of fair girls came,</span>
<span class="i0">With flowers and music, greeting him by name,</span>
<span class="i0">And praising him; but ever like a dream</span>
<span class="i0">He could not break, did all to Ogier seem,</span>
<span class="i0">And he his old world did the more desire,</span>
<span class="i0">For in his heart still burned unquenched the fire,</span>
<span class="i0">That through the world of old so bright did burn:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet was he fain that kindness to return,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the depth of his full heart he sighed.</span>
<span class="i2">Then toward the house the lovely Queen did guide</span>
<span class="i0">His listless steps, and seemed to take no thought</span>
<span class="i0">Of knitted brow or wandering eyes distraught,</span>
<span class="i0">But still with kind love lighting up her face</span>
<span class="i0">She led him through the door of that fair place,</span>
<span class="i0">While round about them did the damsels press;</span>
<span class="i0">And he was moved by all that loveliness</span>
<span class="i0">As one might be, who, lying half asleep</span>
<span class="i0">In the May morning, notes the light wind sweep</span>
<span class="i0">Over the tulip-beds: no more to him</span>
<span class="i0">Were gleaming eyes, red lips, and bodies slim,</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst that dream, although the first surprise</span>
<span class="i0">Of hurried love wherewith the Queen's sweet eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Had smitten him, still in his heart did stir.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And so at last he came, led on by her</span>
<span class="i0">Into a hall wherein a fair throne was,</span>
<span class="i0">And hand in hand thereto the twain did pass;</span>
<span class="i0">And there she bade him sit, and when alone</span>
<span class="i0">He took his place upon the double throne,</span>
<span class="i0">She cast herself before him on her knees,</span>
<span class="i0">Embracing his, and greatly did increase</span>
<span class="i0">The shame and love that vexed his troubled heart:</span>
<span class="i0">But now a line of girls the crowd did part,</span>
<span class="i0">Lovelier than all, and Ogier could behold</span>
<span class="i0">One in their midst who bore a crown of gold</span>
<span class="i0">Within her slender hands and delicate;</span>
<span class="i0">She, drawing nigh, beside the throne did wait</span>
<span class="i0">Until the Queen arose and took the crown,</span>
<span class="i0">Who then to Ogier's lips did stoop adown</span>
<span class="i0">And kissed him, and said, "Ogier, what were worth</span>
<span class="i0">Thy miserable days of strife on earth,</span>
<span class="i0">That on their ashes still thine eyes are turned?"</span>
<span class="i2">Then, as she spoke these words, his changed heart burned</span>
<span class="i0">With sudden memories, and thereto had he</span>
<span class="i0">Made answer, but she raised up suddenly</span>
<span class="i0">The crown she held and set it on his head,</span>
<span class="i0">"Ogier," she cried, "those troublous days are dead;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert dead with them also, but for me;</span>
<span class="i0">Turn unto her who wrought these things for thee!"</span>
<span class="i2">Then, as he felt her touch, a mighty wave</span>
<span class="i0">Of love swept o'er his soul, as though the grave</span>
<span class="i0">Did really hold his body; from his seat</span>
<span class="i0">He rose to cast himself before her feet;</span>
<span class="i0">But she clung round him, and in close embrace</span>
<span class="i0">The twain were locked amidst that thronging place.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Thenceforth new life indeed has Ogier won,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the happy land of Avallon</span>
<span class="i0">Quick glide the years o'er his unchanging head;</span>
<span class="i0">There saw he many men the world thought dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Living like him in sweet forgetfulness</span>
<span class="i0">Of all the troubles that did once oppress</span>
<span class="i0">Their vainly-struggling lives&mdash;ah, how can I</span>
<span class="i0">Tell of their joy as though I had been nigh?</span>
<span class="i0">Suffice it that no fear of death they knew,</span>
<span class="i0">That there no talk there was of false or true,</span>
<span class="i0">Of right or wrong, for traitors came not there;</span>
<span class="i0">That everything was bright and soft and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet they wearied not for any change,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor unto them did constancy seem strange.</span>
<span class="i0">Love knew they, but its pain they never had,</span>
<span class="i0">But with each other's joy were they made glad;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor were their lives wasted by hidden fire,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew they of the unfulfilled desire</span>
<span class="i0">That turns to ashes all the joys of earth,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew they yearning love amidst the dearth</span>
<span class="i0">Of kind and loving hearts to spend it on,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor dreamed or discontent when all was won;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor need they struggle after wealth and fame;</span>
<span class="i0">Still was the calm flow of their lives the same,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, I say, they wearied not of it&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">So did the promised days by Ogier flit.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Think</span> that a hundred years have now passed by,</span>
<span class="i0">Since ye beheld Ogier lie down to die</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the fountain; think that now ye are</span>
<span class="i0">In France, made dangerous with wasting war;</span>
<span class="i0">In Paris, where about each guarded gate,</span>
<span class="i0">Gathered in knots, the anxious people wait,</span>
<span class="i0">And press around each new-come man to learn</span>
<span class="i0">If Harfleur now the pagan wasters burn,</span>
<span class="i0">Or if the Rouen folk can keep their chain,</span>
<span class="i0">Or Pont de l'Arche unburnt still guards the Seine?</span>
<span class="i0">Or if 'tis true that Andelys succour wants?</span>
<span class="i0">That Vernon's folk are fleeing east to Mantes?</span>
<span class="i0">When will they come? or rather is it true</span>
<span class="i0">That a great band the Constable o'erthrew</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the marshes of the lower Seine,</span>
<span class="i0">And that their long ships, turning back again,</span>
<span class="i0">Caught by the high-raised waters of the bore</span>
<span class="i0">Were driven here and there and cast ashore?</span>
<span class="i2">Such questions did they ask, and, as fresh men</span>
<span class="i0">Came hurrying in, they asked them o'er again,</span>
<span class="i0">And from scared folk, or fools, or ignorant,</span>
<span class="i0">Still got new lies, or tidings very scant.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But now amidst these men at last came one,</span>
<span class="i0">A little ere the setting of the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">With two stout men behind him, armed right well,</span>
<span class="i0">Who ever as they rode on, sooth to tell,</span>
<span class="i0">With doubtful eyes upon their master stared,</span>
<span class="i0">Or looked about like troubled men and scared.</span>
<span class="i0">And he they served was noteworthy indeed;</span>
<span class="i0">Of ancient fashion were his arms and weed,</span>
<span class="i0">Rich past the wont of men in those sad times;</span>
<span class="i0">His face was bronzed, as though by burning climes,</span>
<span class="i0">But lovely as the image of a god</span>
<span class="i0">Carved in the days before on earth Christ trod;</span>
<span class="i0">But solemn were his eyes, and grey as glass,</span>
<span class="i0">And like to ruddy gold his fine hair was:</span>
<span class="i0">A mighty man he was, and taller far</span>
<span class="i0">Than those who on that day must bear the war</span>
<span class="i0">The pagans waged: he by the warders stayed</span>
<span class="i0">Scarce looked on them, but straight their words obeyed</span>
<span class="i0">And showed his pass; then, asked about his name</span>
<span class="i0">And from what city of the world he came,</span>
<span class="i0">Said, that men called him now the Ancient Knight,</span>
<span class="i0">That he was come midst the king's men to fight</span>
<span class="i0">From St. Omer's; and as he spoke, he gazed</span>
<span class="i0">Down on the thronging street as one amazed,</span>
<span class="i0">And answered no more to the questioning</span>
<span class="i0">Of frightened folk of this or that sad thing;</span>
<span class="i0">But, ere he passed on, turned about at last</span>
<span class="i0">And on the wondering guard a strange look cast,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "St. Mary! do such men as ye</span>
<span class="i0">Fight with the wasters from across the sea?</span>
<span class="i0">Then, certes, are ye lost, however good</span>
<span class="i0">Your hearts may be; not such were those who stood</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the Hammer-bearer years agone."</span>
<span class="i2">So said he, and as his fair armour shone</span>
<span class="i0">With beauty of a time long passed away,</span>
<span class="i0">So with the music of another day</span>
<span class="i0">His deep voice thrilled the awe-struck, listening folk.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Yet from the crowd a mocking voice outbroke,</span>
<span class="i0">That cried, "Be merry, masters, fear ye nought,</span>
<span class="i0">Surely good succour to our side is brought;</span>
<span class="i0">For here is Charlemaine come off his tomb</span>
<span class="i0">To save his faithful city from its doom."</span>
<span class="i2">"Yea," said another, "this is certain news,</span>
<span class="i0">Surely ye know how all the carvers use</span>
<span class="i0">To carve the dead man's image at the best,</span>
<span class="i0">That guards the place where he may lie at rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore this living image looks indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">Spite of his ancient tongue and marvellous weed,</span>
<span class="i0">To have but thirty summers."</span>
<span class="i8">At the name</span>
<span class="i0">Of Charlemaine, he turned to whence there came</span>
<span class="i0">The mocking voice, and somewhat knit his brow,</span>
<span class="i0">And seemed as he would speak, but scarce knew how;</span>
<span class="i0">So with a half-sigh soon sank back again</span>
<span class="i0">Into his dream, and shook his well-wrought rein,</span>
<span class="i0">And silently went on upon his way.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And this was Ogier: on what evil day</span>
<span class="i0">Has he then stumbled, that he needs must come,</span>
<span class="i0">Midst war and ravage, to the ancient home</span>
<span class="i0">Of his desires? did he grow weary then,</span>
<span class="i0">And wish to strive once more with foolish men</span>
<span class="i0">For worthless things? or is fair Avallon</span>
<span class="i0">Sunk in the sea, and all that glory gone?</span>
<span class="i2">Nay, thus it happed&mdash;One day she came to him</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Ogier, thy name is waxen dim</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the world that thou rememberest not;</span>
<span class="i0">The heathen men are thick on many a spot</span>
<span class="i0">Thine eyes have seen, and which I love therefore;</span>
<span class="i0">And God will give His wonted help no more.</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou, then, help? canst thou have any mind</span>
<span class="i0">To give thy banner once more to the wind?</span>
<span class="i0">Since greater glory thou shalt win for this</span>
<span class="i0">Than erst thou gatheredst ere thou cam'st to bliss:</span>
<span class="i0">For men are dwindled both in heart and frame,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor holds the fair land any such a name</span>
<span class="i0">As thine, when thou wert living midst thy peers:</span>
<span class="i0">The world is worser for these hundred years."</span>
<span class="i2">From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his voice was something of desire,</span>
<span class="i0">To see the land where he was used to be,</span>
<span class="i0">As now he answered: "Nay, choose thou for me,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art the wisest; it is more than well</span>
<span class="i0">Within this peaceful place with thee to dwell:</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ill perchance in that old land to die,</span>
<span class="i0">If, dying, I keep not the memory</span>
<span class="i0">Of this fair life of ours." "Nay, nay," said she,</span>
<span class="i0">"As to thy dying, that shall never be,</span>
<span class="i0">Whiles that thou keep'st my ring&mdash;and now, behold,</span>
<span class="i0">I take from thee thy charmed crown of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou wilt be the Ogier that thou wast</span>
<span class="i0">Ere on the loadstone rock thy ship was cast:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet thou shalt have thy youthful body still,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will guard thy life from every ill."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So was it done, and Ogier, armed right well,</span>
<span class="i0">Sleeping, was borne away by some strong spell,</span>
<span class="i0">And set upon the Flemish coast; and thence</span>
<span class="i0">Turned to St. Omer's, with a doubtful sense</span>
<span class="i0">Of being in some wild dream, the while he knew</span>
<span class="i0">That great delight forgotten was his due,</span>
<span class="i0">That all which there might hap was of small worth.</span>
<span class="i2">So on he went, and sometimes unto mirth</span>
<span class="i0">Did his attire move the country-folk,</span>
<span class="i0">But oftener when strange speeches from him broke</span>
<span class="i0">Concerning men and things for long years dead,</span>
<span class="i0">He filled the listeners with great awe and dread;</span>
<span class="i0">For in such wild times as these people were</span>
<span class="i0">Are men soon moved to wonder and to fear.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now through the streets of Paris did he ride,</span>
<span class="i0">And at a certain hostel did abide</span>
<span class="i0">Throughout that night, and ere he went next day</span>
<span class="i0">He saw a book that on a table lay,</span>
<span class="i0">And opening it 'gan read in lazy mood:</span>
<span class="i0">But long before it in that place he stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Noting nought else; for it did chronicle</span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of men of old he knew right well,</span>
<span class="i0">When they were living in the flesh with him:</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, his own deeds he saw, grown strange and dim</span>
<span class="i0">Already, and true stories mixed with lies,</span>
<span class="i0">Until, with many thronging memories</span>
<span class="i0">Of those old days, his heart was so oppressed,</span>
<span class="i0">He 'gan to wish that he might lie at rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting all things: for indeed by this</span>
<span class="i0">Little remembrance had he of the bliss</span>
<span class="i0">That wrapped his soul in peaceful Avallon.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But his changed life he needs must carry on;</span>
<span class="i0">For ye shall know the Queen was gathering men</span>
<span class="i0">To send unto the good King, who as then</span>
<span class="i0">In Rouen lay, beset by many a band</span>
<span class="i0">Of those who carried terror through the land,</span>
<span class="i0">And still by messengers for help he prayed:</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore a mighty muster was being made,</span>
<span class="i0">Of weak and strong, and brave and timorous,</span>
<span class="i0">Before the Queen anigh her royal house.</span>
<span class="i0">So thither on this morn did Ogier turn,</span>
<span class="i0">Some certain news about the war to learn;</span>
<span class="i0">And when he came at last into the square,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw the ancient palace great and fair</span>
<span class="i0">Rise up before him as in other days,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the merry morn the bright sun's rays</span>
<span class="i0">Glittering on gathering helms and moving spears,</span>
<span class="i0">He 'gan to feel as in the long-past years,</span>
<span class="i0">And his heart stirred within him. Now the Queen</span>
<span class="i0">Came from within, right royally beseen,</span>
<span class="i0">And took her seat beneath a canopy,</span>
<span class="i0">With lords and captains of the war anigh;</span>
<span class="i0">And as she came a mighty shout arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And round about began the knights to close,</span>
<span class="i0">Their oath of fealty there to swear anew,</span>
<span class="i0">And learn what service they had got to do.</span>
<span class="i0">But so it was, that some their shouts must stay</span>
<span class="i0">To gaze at Ogier as he took his way</span>
<span class="i0">Through the thronged place; and quickly too he gat</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the place whereas the Lady sat,</span>
<span class="i0">For men gave place unto him, fearing him:</span>
<span class="i0">For not alone was he most huge of limb,</span>
<span class="i0">And dangerous, but something in his face,</span>
<span class="i0">As his calm eyes looked o'er the crowded place,</span>
<span class="i0">Struck men with awe; and in the ancient days,</span>
<span class="i0">When men might hope alive on gods to gaze,</span>
<span class="i0">They would have thought, "The gods yet love our town</span>
<span class="i0">And from the heavens have sent a great one down."</span>
<span class="i2">Withal unto the throne he came so near,</span>
<span class="i0">That he the Queen's sweet measured voice could hear;</span>
<span class="i0">And swiftly now within him wrought the change</span>
<span class="i0">That first he felt amid those faces strange;</span>
<span class="i0">And his heart burned to taste the hurrying life</span>
<span class="i0">With such desires, such changing sweetness rife.</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, indeed, how should he live alone,</span>
<span class="i0">Who in the old past days such friends had known?</span>
<span class="i0">Then he began to think of Caraheu,</span>
<span class="i0">Of Bellicent the fair, and once more knew</span>
<span class="i0">The bitter pain of rent and ended love.</span>
<span class="i0">But while with hope and vain regret he strove,</span>
<span class="i0">He found none 'twixt him and the Queen's high seat,</span>
<span class="i0">And, stepping forth, he knelt before her feet</span>
<span class="i0">And took her hand to swear, as was the way</span>
<span class="i0">Of doing fealty in that ancient day,</span>
<span class="i0">And raised his eyes to hers; as fair was she</span>
<span class="i0">As any woman of the world might be</span>
<span class="i0">Full-limbed and tall, dark haired, from her deep eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">The snare of fools, the ruin of the wise,</span>
<span class="i0">Love looked unchecked; and now her dainty hand,</span>
<span class="i0">The well-knit holder of the golden wand,</span>
<span class="i0">Trembled in his, she cast her eyes adown,</span>
<span class="i0">And her sweet brow was knitted to a frown,</span>
<span class="i0">As he, the taker of such oaths of yore,</span>
<span class="i0">Now unto her all due obedience swore,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet gave himself no name; and now the Queen,</span>
<span class="i0">Awed by his voice as other folk had been,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise</span>
<span class="i0">Too sweet to think of, and with love's surprise</span>
<span class="i0">Her cheek grew pale; she said, "Thy style and name</span>
<span class="i0">Thou tellest not, nor what land of thy fame</span>
<span class="i0">Is glad; for, certes, some land must be glad,</span>
<span class="i0">That in its bounds her house thy mother had."</span>
<span class="i2">"Lady," he said, "from what far land I come</span>
<span class="i0">I well might tell thee, but another home</span>
<span class="i0">Have I long dwelt in, and its name have I</span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten now, forgotten utterly</span>
<span class="i0">Who were my fellows, and what deeds they did;</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, indeed, shall my first name be hid</span>
<span class="i0">And my first country; call me on this day</span>
<span class="i0">The Ancient Knight, and let me go my way."</span>
<span class="i0">He rose withal, for she her fingers fair</span>
<span class="i0">Had drawn aback, and on him 'gan to stare</span>
<span class="i0">As one afeard; for something terrible</span>
<span class="i0">Was in his speech, and that she knew right well,</span>
<span class="i0">Who 'gan to love him, and to fear that she,</span>
<span class="i0">Shut out by some strange deadly mystery,</span>
<span class="i0">Should never gain from him an equal love;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as from her high seat he 'gan to move,</span>
<span class="i0">She said, "O Ancient Knight, come presently,</span>
<span class="i0">When we have done this muster, unto me,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt have thy charge and due command</span>
<span class="i0">For freeing from our foes this wretched land!"</span>
<span class="i2">Then Ogier made his reverence and went,</span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat could perceive of her intent;</span>
<span class="i0">For in his heart life grew, and love with life</span>
<span class="i0">Grew, and therewith, 'twixt love and fame, was strife.</span>
<span class="i2">But, as he slowly gat him from the square,</span>
<span class="i0">Gazing at all the people gathered there,</span>
<span class="i0">A squire of the Queen's behind him came,</span>
<span class="i0">And breathless, called him by his new-coined name,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade him turn because the Queen now bade,</span>
<span class="i0">Since by the muster long she might be stayed,</span>
<span class="i0">That to the palace he should bring him straight,</span>
<span class="i0">Midst sport and play her coming back to wait;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Ogier turned, nought loath, and with him went,</span>
<span class="i0">And to a postern-gate his steps he bent,</span>
<span class="i0">That Ogier knew right well in days of old;</span>
<span class="i0">Worn was it now, and the bright hues and gold</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the shields above, with lapse of days,</span>
<span class="i0">Were faded much: but now did Ogier gaze</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the garden where he walked of yore,</span>
<span class="i0">Holding the hands that he should see no more;</span>
<span class="i0">For all was changed except the palace fair,</span>
<span class="i0">That Charlemaine's own eyes had seen built there</span>
<span class="i0">Ere Ogier knew him; there the squire did lead</span>
<span class="i0">The Ancient Knight, who still took little heed</span>
<span class="i0">Of all the things that by the way he said,</span>
<span class="i0">For all his thoughts were on the days long dead.</span>
<span class="i2">There in the painted hall he sat again,</span>
<span class="i0">And 'neath the pictured eyes of Charlemaine</span>
<span class="i0">He ate and drank, and felt it like a dream;</span>
<span class="i0">And midst his growing longings yet might deem</span>
<span class="i0">That he from sleep should wake up presently</span>
<span class="i0">In some fair city on the Syrian sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Or on the brown rocks of the loadstone isle.</span>
<span class="i0">But fain to be alone, within a while</span>
<span class="i0">He gat him to the garden, and there passed</span>
<span class="i0">By wondering squires and damsels, till at last,</span>
<span class="i0">Far from the merry folk who needs must play,</span>
<span class="i0">If on the world were coming its last day,</span>
<span class="i0">He sat him down, and through his mind there ran</span>
<span class="i0">Faint thoughts of that day, when, outworn and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">He lay down by the fountain-side to die.</span>
<span class="i0">But when he strove to gain clear memory</span>
<span class="i0">Of what had happed since on the isle he lay</span>
<span class="i0">Waiting for death, a hopeless castaway,</span>
<span class="i0">Thought failing him, would rather bring again</span>
<span class="i0">His life among the peers of Charlemaine,</span>
<span class="i0">And vex his soul with hapless memories;</span>
<span class="i0">Until at last, worn out by thought of these,</span>
<span class="i0">And hopeless striving to find what was true,</span>
<span class="i0">And pondering on the deeds he had to do</span>
<span class="i0">Ere he returned, whereto he could not tell,</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet sleep upon his wearied spirit fell.</span>
<span class="i0">And on the afternoon of that fair day,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting all, beneath the trees he lay.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Meanwhile the Queen, affairs of state being done,</span>
<span class="i0">Went through the gardens with one dame alone</span>
<span class="i0">Seeking for Ogier, whom at last she found</span>
<span class="i0">Laid sleeping on the daisy-sprinkled ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming, I know not what, of other days.</span>
<span class="i0">Then on him for a while the Queen did gaze,</span>
<span class="i0">Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight,</span>
<span class="i0">Then to her fellow turned, "The ancient Knight&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">What means he by this word of his?" she said;</span>
<span class="i0">"He were well mated with some lovely maid</span>
<span class="i0">Just pondering on the late-heard name of love."</span>
<span class="i2">"Softly, my lady, he begins to move,"</span>
<span class="i0">Her fellow said, a woman old and grey;</span>
<span class="i0">"Look now, his arms are of another day;</span>
<span class="i0">None know him or his deeds; thy squire just said</span>
<span class="i0">He asked about the state of men long dead;</span>
<span class="i0">I fear what he may be; look, seest thou not</span>
<span class="i0">That ring that on one finger he has got,</span>
<span class="i0">Where figures strange upon the gold are wrought:</span>
<span class="i0">God grant that he from hell has not been brought</span>
<span class="i0">For our confusion, in this doleful war,</span>
<span class="i0">Who surely in enough of trouble are</span>
<span class="i0">Without such help;" then the Queen turned aside</span>
<span class="i0">Awhile, her drawn and troubled face to hide,</span>
<span class="i0">For lurking dread this speech within her stirred;</span>
<span class="i0">But yet she said, "Thou sayest a foolish word,</span>
<span class="i0">This man is come against our enemies</span>
<span class="i0">To fight for us." Then down upon her knees</span>
<span class="i0">Fell the old woman by the sleeping knight,</span>
<span class="i0">And from his hand she drew with fingers light</span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous ring, and scarce again could rise</span>
<span class="i0">Ere 'neath the trembling Queen's bewildered eyes</span>
<span class="i0">The change began; his golden hair turned white,</span>
<span class="i0">His smooth cheek wrinkled, and his breathing light</span>
<span class="i0">Was turned to troublous struggling for his breath,</span>
<span class="i0">And on his shrunk lips lay the hand of death;</span>
<span class="i0">And, scarce less pale than he, the trembling Queen</span>
<span class="i0">Stood thinking on the beauty she had seen</span>
<span class="i0">And longed for but a little while ago,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet with her terror still her love did grow,</span>
<span class="i0">And she began to weep as though she saw</span>
<span class="i0">Her beauty e'en to such an ending draw.</span>
<span class="i0">And 'neath her tears waking he oped his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And strove to speak, but nought but gasping sighs</span>
<span class="i0">His lips could utter; then he tried to reach</span>
<span class="i0">His hand to them, as though he would beseech</span>
<span class="i0">The gift of what was his: but all the while</span>
<span class="i0">The crone gazed on them with an evil smile,</span>
<span class="i0">Then holding toward the Queen that wondrous ring,</span>
<span class="i0">She said, "Why weep'st thou? having this fair thing,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou, losing nought the beauty that thou hast,</span>
<span class="i0">May'st watch the vainly struggling world go past,</span>
<span class="i0">Thyself unchanged." The Queen put forth her hand</span>
<span class="i0">And took the ring, and there awhile did stand</span>
<span class="i0">And strove to think of it, but still in her</span>
<span class="i0">Such all-absorbing longings love did stir,</span>
<span class="i0">So young she was, of death she could not think,</span>
<span class="i0">Or what a cup eld gives to man to drink;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet on her finger had she set the ring</span>
<span class="i0">When now the life that hitherto did cling</span>
<span class="i0">To Ogier's heart seemed fading quite away,</span>
<span class="i0">And scarcely breathing with shut eyes he lay.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, kneeling down, she murmured piteously,</span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, wilt thou love me if I give it thee,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou grow'st young again? what should I do</span>
<span class="i0">If with the eyes thou thus shalt gain anew</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shouldst look scorn on me?" But with that word</span>
<span class="i0">The hedge behind her, by the west wind stirred,</span>
<span class="i0">Cast fear into her heart of some one nigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And therewith on his finger hastily</span>
<span class="i0">She set the ring, then rose and stood apart</span>
<span class="i0">A little way, and in her doubtful heart</span>
<span class="i0">With love and fear was mixed desire of life.</span>
<span class="i2">But standing so, a look with great scorn rife</span>
<span class="i0">The elder woman, turning, cast on her,</span>
<span class="i0">Pointing to Ogier, who began to stir;</span>
<span class="i0">She looked, and all she erst saw now did seem</span>
<span class="i0">To have been nothing but a hideous dream,</span>
<span class="i0">As fair and young he rose from off the ground</span>
<span class="i0">And cast a dazed and puzzled look around,</span>
<span class="i0">Like one just waked from sleep in some strange place;</span>
<span class="i0">But soon his grave eyes rested on her face,</span>
<span class="i0">And turned yet graver seeing her so pale,</span>
<span class="i0">And that her eyes were pregnant with some tale</span>
<span class="i0">Of love and fear; she 'neath his eyes the while</span>
<span class="i0">Forced her pale lips to semblance of a smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "O Ancient Knight, thou sleepest then?</span>
<span class="i0">While through this poor land range the heathen men,</span>
<span class="i0">Unmet of any but my King and Lord:</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, let us see the deeds of thine old sword."</span>
<span class="i2">"Queen," said he, "bid me then unto this work,</span>
<span class="i0">And certes I behind no wall would lurk,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor send for succour, while a scanty folk</span>
<span class="i0">Still followed after me to break the yoke:</span>
<span class="i0">I pray thee grace for sleeping, and were fain</span>
<span class="i0">That I might rather never sleep again</span>
<span class="i0">Than have such wretched dreams as I e'en now</span>
<span class="i0">Have waked from."</span>
<span class="i8">Lovelier she seemed to grow</span>
<span class="i0">Unto him as he spoke; fresh colour came</span>
<span class="i0">Into her face, as though for some sweet shame,</span>
<span class="i0">While she with tearful eyes beheld him so,</span>
<span class="i0">That somewhat even must his burnt cheek glow,</span>
<span class="i0">His heart beat faster. But again she said,</span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, will dreams burden such a mighty head?</span>
<span class="i0">Then may I too have pardon for a dream:</span>
<span class="i0">Last night in sleep I saw thee, who didst seem</span>
<span class="i0">To be the King of France; and thou and I</span>
<span class="i0">Were sitting at some great festivity</span>
<span class="i0">Within the many-peopled gold-hung place."</span>
<span class="i2">The blush of shame was gone as on his face</span>
<span class="i0">She gazed, and saw him read her meaning clear</span>
<span class="i0">And knew that no cold words she had to fear,</span>
<span class="i0">But rather that for softer speech he yearned.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, with love alone her smooth cheek burned;</span>
<span class="i0">Her parted lips were hungry for his kiss,</span>
<span class="i0">She trembled at the near approaching bliss;</span>
<span class="i2">Nathless, she checked her love a little while,</span>
<span class="i0">Because she felt the old dame's curious smile</span>
<span class="i0">Upon her, and she said, "O Ancient Knight,</span>
<span class="i0">If I then read my last night's dream aright,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art come here our very help to be,</span>
<span class="i0">Perchance to give my husband back to me;</span>
<span class="i0">Come then, if thou this land art fain to save,</span>
<span class="i0">And show the wisdom thou must surely have</span>
<span class="i0">Unto my council; I will give thee then</span>
<span class="i0">What charge I may among my valiant men;</span>
<span class="i0">And certes thou wilt do so well herein,</span>
<span class="i0">That, ere long, something greater shalt thou win:</span>
<span class="i0">Come, then, deliverer of my throne and land,</span>
<span class="i0">And let me touch for once thy mighty hand</span>
<span class="i0">With these weak fingers."</span>
<span class="i8">As she spoke, she met</span>
<span class="i0">His eager hand, and all things did forget</span>
<span class="i0">But for one moment, for too wise were they</span>
<span class="i0">To cast the coming years of joy away;</span>
<span class="i0">Then with her other hand her gown she raised</span>
<span class="i0">And led him thence, and o'er her shoulder gazed</span>
<span class="i0">At her old follower with a doubtful smile,</span>
<span class="i0">As though to say, "Be wise, I know thy guile!"</span>
<span class="i2">But slowly she behind the lovers walked,</span>
<span class="i0">Muttering, "So be it! thou shalt not be balked</span>
<span class="i0">Of thy desire; be merry! I am wise,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I rob thee of thy Paradise</span>
<span class="i0">For any other than myself; and thou</span>
<span class="i0">May'st even happen to have had enow</span>
<span class="i0">Of this new love, before I get the ring,</span>
<span class="i0">And I may work for thee no evil thing."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now ye shall know that the old chronicle,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein I read all this, doth duly tell</span>
<span class="i0">Of all the gallant deeds that Ogier did,</span>
<span class="i0">There may ye read them; nor let me be chid</span>
<span class="i0">If I therefore say little of these things,</span>
<span class="i0">Because the thought of Avallon still clings</span>
<span class="i0">Unto my heart, and scarcely can I bear</span>
<span class="i0">To think of that long, dragging useless year,</span>
<span class="i0">Through which, with dulled and glimmering memory,</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier was grown content to live and die</span>
<span class="i0">Like other men; but this I have to say,</span>
<span class="i0">That in the council chamber on that day</span>
<span class="i0">The Old Knight showed his wisdom well enow,</span>
<span class="i0">While fainter still with love the Queen did grow</span>
<span class="i0">Hearing his words, beholding his grey eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Flashing with fire of warlike memories;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, at the last he seemed so wise indeed</span>
<span class="i0">That she could give him now the charge, to lead</span>
<span class="i0">One wing of the great army that set out</span>
<span class="i0">From Paris' gates, midst many a wavering shout</span>
<span class="i0">Midst trembling prayers, and unchecked wails and tears,</span>
<span class="i0">And slender hopes and unresisted fears.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now ere he went, upon his bed he lay,</span>
<span class="i0">Newly awakened at the dawn of day,</span>
<span class="i0">Gathering perplexed thoughts of many a thing,</span>
<span class="i0">When, midst the carol that the birds did sing</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the coming of the hopeful sun,</span>
<span class="i0">He heard a sudden lovesome song begun</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt two young voices in the garden green,</span>
<span class="i0">That seemed indeed the farewell of the Queen.</span>

&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Soothed by the pleasure that the music brought</span>
<span class="i0">And sweet desire, and vague and dreamy thought</span>
<span class="i0">Of happiness it seemed to promise him,</span>
<span class="i0">He lay and listened till his eyes grew dim,</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er him 'gan forgetfulness to creep</span>
<span class="i0">Till in the growing light he lay asleep,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor woke until the clanging trumpet-blast</span>
<span class="i0">Had summoned him all thought away to cast:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet one more joy of love indeed he had</span>
<span class="i0">Ere with the battle's noise he was made glad;</span>
<span class="i0">For, as on that May morning forth they rode</span>
<span class="i0">And passed before the Queen's most fair abode,</span>
<span class="i0">There at a window was she waiting them</span>
<span class="i0">In fair attire with gold in every hem,</span>
<span class="i0">And as the ancient Knight beneath her passed</span>
<span class="i0">A wreath of flowering white-thorn down she cast,</span>
<span class="i0">And looked farewell to him, and forth he set</span>
<span class="i0">Thinking of all the pleasure he should get</span>
<span class="i0">From love and war, forgetting Avallon</span>
<span class="i0">And all that lovely life so lightly won;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, now indeed the earthly life o'erpast</span>
<span class="i0">Ere on the loadstone rock his ship was cast</span>
<span class="i0">Was waxing dim, nor yet at all he learned</span>
<span class="i0">To 'scape the fire that erst his heart had burned.</span>
<span class="i0">And he forgat his deeds, forgat his fame,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgat the letters of his ancient name</span>
<span class="i0">As one waked fully shall forget a dream,</span>
<span class="i0">That once to him a wondrous tale did seem.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now I, though writing here no chronicle</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as I said, must nathless shortly tell</span>
<span class="i0">That, ere the army Rouen's gates could gain</span>
<span class="i0">By a broad arrow had the King been slain,</span>
<span class="i0">And helpless now the wretched country lay</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the yoke, until the glorious day</span>
<span class="i0">When Ogier fell at last upon the foe,</span>
<span class="i0">And scattered them as helplessly as though</span>
<span class="i0">They had been beaten men without a name:</span>
<span class="i0">So when to Paris town once more he came</span>
<span class="i0">Few folk the memory of the King did keep</span>
<span class="i0">Within their hearts, and if the folk did weep</span>
<span class="i0">At his returning, 'twas for joy indeed</span>
<span class="i0">That such a man had risen at their need</span>
<span class="i0">To work for them so great deliverance,</span>
<span class="i0">And loud they called on him for King of France.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But if the Queen's heart were the more a-flame</span>
<span class="i0">For all that she had heard of his great fame,</span>
<span class="i0">I know not; rather with some hidden dread</span>
<span class="i0">Of coming fate, she heard her lord was dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And her false dream seemed coming true at last,</span>
<span class="i0">For the clear sky of love seemed overcast</span>
<span class="i0">With clouds of God's great judgments, and the fear</span>
<span class="i0">Of hate and final parting drawing near.</span>
<span class="i2">So now when he before her throne did stand</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the throng as saviour of the land,</span>
<span class="i0">And she her eyes to his kind eyes did raise,</span>
<span class="i0">And there before all her own love must praise;</span>
<span class="i0">Then did she fall a-weeping, and folk said,</span>
<span class="i0">"See, how she sorrows for the newly dead!</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst our joy she needs must think of him;</span>
<span class="i0">Let be, full surely shall her grief wax dim</span>
<span class="i0">And she shall wed again."</span>
<span class="i8">So passed the year,</span>
<span class="i0">While Ogier set himself the land to clear</span>
<span class="i0">Of broken remnants of the heathen men,</span>
<span class="i0">And at the last, when May-time came again,</span>
<span class="i0">Must he be crowned King of the twice-saved land,</span>
<span class="i0">And at the altar take the fair Queen's hand</span>
<span class="i0">And wed her for his own. And now by this</span>
<span class="i0">Had he forgotten clean the woe and bliss</span>
<span class="i0">Of his old life, and still was he made glad</span>
<span class="i0">As other men; and hopes and fears he had</span>
<span class="i0">As others, and bethought him not at all</span>
<span class="i0">Of what strange days upon him yet should fall</span>
<span class="i0">When he should live and these again be dead.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now drew the time round when he should be wed,</span>
<span class="i0">And in his palace on his bed he lay</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the dawning of the very day:</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt sleep and waking was he, and could hear</span>
<span class="i0">E'en at that hour, through the bright morn and clear,</span>
<span class="i0">The hammering of the folk who toiled to make</span>
<span class="i0">Some well-wrought stages for the pageant's sake,</span>
<span class="i0">Though hardly yet the sparrows had begun</span>
<span class="i0">To twitter o'er the coming of the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor through the palace did a creature move.</span>
<span class="i2">There in the sweet entanglement of love</span>
<span class="i0">Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay,</span>
<span class="i0">Remembering no more of that other day</span>
<span class="i0">Than the hot noon remembereth of the night,</span>
<span class="i0">Than summer thinketh of the winter white.</span>
<span class="i2">In that sweet hour he heard a voice that cried,</span>
<span class="i0">"Ogier, Ogier!" then, opening his eyes wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And rising on his elbow, gazed around,</span>
<span class="i0">And strange to him and empty was the sound</span>
<span class="i0">Of his own name; "Whom callest thou?" he said.</span>
<span class="i0">"For I, the man who lies upon this bed,</span>
<span class="i0">Am Charles of France, and shall be King to-day,</span>
<span class="i0">But in a year that now is past away</span>
<span class="i0">The Ancient Knight they called me: who is this,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou callest Ogier, then, what deeds are his?</span>
<span class="i0">And who art thou?" But at that word a sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">As of one grieved, came from some place anigh</span>
<span class="i0">His bed-side, and a soft voice spake again,</span>
<span class="i0">"This Ogier once was great amongst great men;</span>
<span class="i0">To Italy a helpless hostage led;</span>
<span class="i0">He saved the King when the false Lombard fled,</span>
<span class="i0">Bore forth the Oriflamme and gained the day;</span>
<span class="i0">Charlot he brought back, whom men led away,</span>
<span class="i0">And fought a day-long fight with Caraheu.</span>
<span class="i0">The ravager of Rome his right hand slew;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor did he fear the might of Charlemaine,</span>
<span class="i0">Who for a dreary year beset in vain</span>
<span class="i0">His lonely castle; yet at last caught then,</span>
<span class="i0">And shut in hold, needs must he come again</span>
<span class="i0">To give an unhoped great deliverance</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the burdened helpless land of France:</span>
<span class="i0">Denmark he gained thereafter, and he wore</span>
<span class="i0">The crown of England drawn from trouble sore;</span>
<span class="i0">At Tyre then he reigned, and Babylon</span>
<span class="i0">With mighty deeds he from the foemen won;</span>
<span class="i0">And when scarce aught could give him greater fame,</span>
<span class="i0">He left the world still thinking on his name.</span>
<span class="i2">"These things did Ogier, and these things didst thou,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I call thee by a new name now</span>
<span class="i0">Since I have spoken words of love to thee&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Ogier, Ogier, dost thou remember me,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en if thou hast no thought of that past time</span>
<span class="i0">Before thou earnest to our happy clime?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">As this was said, his mazed eyes saw indeed</span>
<span class="i0">A lovely woman clad in dainty weed</span>
<span class="i0">Beside his bed, and many a thought was stirred</span>
<span class="i0">Within his heart by that last plaintive word,</span>
<span class="i0">Though nought he said, but waited what should come.</span>
<span class="i0">"Love," said she, "I am here to bring thee home;</span>
<span class="i0">Well hast thou done all that thou cam'st to do,</span>
<span class="i0">And if thou bidest here, for something new</span>
<span class="i0">Will folk begin to cry, and all thy fame</span>
<span class="i0">Shall then avail thee but for greater blame;</span>
<span class="i0">Thy love shall cease to love thee, and the earth</span>
<span class="i0">Thou lovest now shall be of little worth</span>
<span class="i0">While still thou keepest life, abhorring it.</span>
<span class="i0">Behold, in men's lives that so quickly flit</span>
<span class="i0">Thus is it, how then shall it be with thee,</span>
<span class="i0">Who some faint image of eternity</span>
<span class="i0">Hast gained through me?&mdash;alas, thou heedest not!</span>
<span class="i0">On all these changing things thine heart is hot&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Take then this gift that I have brought from far,</span>
<span class="i0">And then may'st thou remember what we are;</span>
<span class="i0">The lover and the loved from long ago."</span>
<span class="i2">He trembled, and more memory seemed to grow</span>
<span class="i0">Within his heart as he beheld her stand,</span>
<span class="i0">Holding a glittering crown in her right hand:</span>
<span class="i0">"Ogier," she said, "arise and do on thee</span>
<span class="i0">The emblems of thy worldly sovereignity,</span>
<span class="i0">For we must pass o'er many a sea this morn."</span>
<span class="i2">He rose, and in the glittering tunic worn</span>
<span class="i0">By Charlemaine he clad himself, and took</span>
<span class="i0">The ivory hand, that Charlemaine once shook</span>
<span class="i0">Over the people's head in days of old;</span>
<span class="i0">Then on his feet he set the shoes of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And o'er his shoulders threw the mantle fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And set the gold crown on his golden hair:</span>
<span class="i0">Then on the royal chair he sat him down,</span>
<span class="i0">As though he deemed the elders of the town</span>
<span class="i0">Should come to audience; and in all he seemed</span>
<span class="i0">To do these things e'en as a man who dreamed.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And now adown the Seine the golden sun</span>
<span class="i0">Shone out, as toward him drew that lovely one</span>
<span class="i0">And took from off his head the royal crown,</span>
<span class="i0">And, smiling, on the pillow laid it down</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Lie there, O crown of Charlemaine,</span>
<span class="i0">Worn by a mighty man, and worn in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">Because he died, and all the things he did</span>
<span class="i0">Were changed before his face by earth was hid;</span>
<span class="i0">A better crown I have for my love's head,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereby he yet shall live, when all are dead</span>
<span class="i0">His hand has helped." Then on his head she set</span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous crown, and said, "Forget, forget!</span>
<span class="i0">Forget these weary things, for thou hast much</span>
<span class="i0">Of happiness to think of."</span>
<span class="i8">At that touch</span>
<span class="i0">He rose, a happy light gleamed in his eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">And smitten by the rush of memories,</span>
<span class="i0">He stammered out, "O love! how came we here?</span>
<span class="i0">What do we in this land of Death and Fear?</span>
<span class="i0">Have I not been from thee a weary while?</span>
<span class="i0">Let us return&mdash;I dreamed about the isle;</span>
<span class="i0">I dreamed of other years of strife and pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Of new years full of struggles long and vain."</span>
<span class="i2">She took him by the hand and said, "Come, love,</span>
<span class="i0">I am not changed;" and therewith did they move</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the door, and through the sleeping place</span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly they went, and still was Ogier's face</span>
<span class="i0">Turned on her beauty, and no thought was his</span>
<span class="i0">Except the dear returning of his bliss.</span>
<span class="i2">But at the threshold of the palace-gate</span>
<span class="i0">That opened to them, she awhile did wait,</span>
<span class="i0">And turned her eyes unto the rippling Seine</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "O love, behold it once again!"</span>
<span class="i0">He turned, and gazed upon the city grey</span>
<span class="i0">Smit by the gold of that sweet morn of May;</span>
<span class="i0">He heard faint noises as of wakening folk</span>
<span class="i0">As on their heads his day of glory broke;</span>
<span class="i0">He heard the changing rush of the swift stream</span>
<span class="i0">Against the bridge-piers. All was grown a dream.</span>
<span class="i0">His work was over, his reward was come,</span>
<span class="i0">Why should he loiter longer from his home?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">A little while she watched him silently,</span>
<span class="i0">Then beckoned him to follow with a sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And, raising up the raiment from her feet,</span>
<span class="i0">Across the threshold stepped into the street;</span>
<span class="i0">One moment on the twain the low sun shone,</span>
<span class="i0">And then the place was void, and they were gone</span>
<span class="i0">How I know not; but this I know indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">That in whatso great trouble or sore need</span>
<span class="i0">The land of France since that fair day has been,</span>
<span class="i0">No more the sword of Ogier has she seen.</span>

<span class="i0"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Such</span> was the tale he told of Avallon,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en such an one as in days past had won</span>
<span class="i0">His youthful heart to think upon the quest;</span>
<span class="i0">But to those old hearts nigh in reach of rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Not much to be desired now it seemed&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Perchance the heart that of such things had dreamed</span>

<span class="i0">The foolish hope that once had glittered there&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Or think, that in some bay of that far home</span>
<span class="i0">They then had sat, and watched the green waves come</span>

<span class="i0">Or the light wind midst blossom-laden trees,</span>
<span class="i0">In the sweet Spring had weighted many a word</span>

<span class="i0">Had no tears left for that once longed-for land,</span>
<span class="i0">The very wind must moan for their decay,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the sky, grown dull, and low, and grey,</span>
<span class="i0">Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field,</span>

<span class="i0">They were not yet of every joy bereft,</span>

<span class="i0">Midst which they found that they indeed must die;</span>
<span class="i0">And now well-nigh as much their pain was past</span>
<span class="i0">As though death's veil already had been cast</span>
<span class="i0">Over their heads&mdash;so, midst some little mirth,</span>
<span class="i0">They watched the dark night hide the gloomy earth.</span>

<p>This tale tells of the voyage of a ship of Tyre, that, against the will
of the shipmen, bore Hercules to an unknown land of the West, that he
might accomplish a task laid on him by the Fates.</p>


<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">As many as the leaves fall from the tree,</span>
<span class="i0">From the world's life the years are fallen away</span>
<span class="i0">Since King Eurystheus sat in majesty</span>
<span class="i0">In fair Mycen&aelig;; midmost of whose day</span>
<span class="i0">It once befell that in a quiet bay</span>
<span class="i0">A ship of Tyre was swinging nigh the shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Her folk for sailing handling rope and oar.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Fresh was the summer morn, a soft wind stole</span>
<span class="i0">Down from the sheep-browsed slopes the cliffs that crowned,</span>
<span class="i0">And ruffled lightly the long gleaming roll</span>
<span class="i0">Of the peaceful sea, and bore along the sound</span>
<span class="i0">Of shepherd-folk and sheep and questing hound,</span>
<span class="i0">For in the first dip of the hillside there</span>
<span class="i0">Lay bosomed 'mid its trees a homestead fair.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Amid regrets for last night, when the moon,</span>
<span class="i0">Risen on the soft dusk, shone on maidens' feet</span>
<span class="i0">Brushing the gold-heart lilies to the tune</span>
<span class="i0">Of pipes complaining, o'er the grass down-beat</span>
<span class="i0">That mixed with dewy flowers its odour sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">The shipmen laboured, till the sail unfurled</span>
<span class="i0">Swung round the prow to meet another world.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But ere the anchor had come home, a shout</span>
<span class="i0">Rang from the strand, as though the ship were hailed.</span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the master bade them stay, in doubt</span>
<span class="i0">That they without some needful thing had sailed;</span>
<span class="i0">When, lo! from where the cliff's steep grey sides failed</span>
<span class="i0">Into a ragged stony slip, came twain</span>
<span class="i0">Who seemed in haste the ready keel to gain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Soon they drew nigh, and he who first came down</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the surf was a man huge of limb,</span>
<span class="i0">Grey-eyed, with crisp-curled hair 'twixt black and brown,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had a lion's skin cast over him,</span>
<span class="i0">So wrought with gold that the fell showed but dim</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the threads, and in his hand he bore</span>
<span class="i0">A mighty club with bands of steel done o'er.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Panting there followed him a grey old man,</span>
<span class="i0">Bearing a long staff, clad in gown of blue,</span>
<span class="i0">Feeble of aspect, hollow-cheeked and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">Who when unto his fellow's side he drew,</span>
<span class="i0">Said faintly: "Now, do that which thou shouldst do;</span>
<span class="i0">This is the ship." Then in the other's eye</span>
<span class="i0">A smile gleamed, and he spake out merrily:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Masters, folk tell me that ye make for Tyre,</span>
<span class="i0">And after that still nearer to the sun;</span>
<span class="i0">And since Fate bids me look to die by fire,</span>
<span class="i0">Fain am I, ere my worldly day be done,</span>
<span class="i0">To know what from earth's hottest can be won;</span>
<span class="i0">And this old man, my kinsman, would with me.</span>
<span class="i0">How say ye, will ye bear us o'er the sea?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"What is thy name?" the master said: "And know</span>
<span class="i0">That we are merchants, and for nought give nought;</span>
<span class="i0">What wilt thou pay?&mdash;thou seem'st full rich, I trow."</span>
<span class="i0">The old man muttered, stooped adown and caught</span>
<span class="i0">At something in the sand: "E'en so I thought,"</span>
<span class="i0">The younger said, "when I set out from home&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">As to my name, perchance in days to come</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Thou shalt know that&mdash;but have heed, take this toy,</span>
<span class="i0">And call me the Strong Man." And as he spake</span>
<span class="i0">The master's deep-brown eyes 'gan gleam with joy,</span>
<span class="i0">For from his arm a huge ring did he take,</span>
<span class="i0">And cast it on the deck, where it did break</span>
<span class="i0">A water-jar, and in the wet shards lay</span>
<span class="i0">Golden, and gleaming like the end of day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But the old man held out a withered hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein there shone two pearls most great and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "If any nigher I might stand,</span>
<span class="i0">Then might'st thou see the things I give thee here&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And for a name&mdash;a many names I bear,</span>
<span class="i0">But call me Shepherd of the Shore this tide,</span>
<span class="i0">And for more knowledge with a good will bide."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">From one to the other turned the master's eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">The Strong Man laughed as at some hidden jest,</span>
<span class="i0">And wild doubts in the shipman's heart did rise;</span>
<span class="i0">But thinking on the thing, he deemed it best</span>
<span class="i0">To bid them come aboard, and take such rest</span>
<span class="i0">As they might have of the untrusty sea,</span>
<span class="i0">'Mid men who trusty fellows still should be.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Then no more words the Strong Man made, but straight</span>
<span class="i0">Caught up the elder in his arms, and so,</span>
<span class="i0">Making no whit of all that added weight,</span>
<span class="i0">Strode to the ship, right through the breakers low,</span>
<span class="i0">And catching at the rope that they did throw</span>
<span class="i0">Out toward his hand, swung up into the ship;</span>
<span class="i0">Then did the master let the hawser slip.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">The shapely prow cleft the wet mead and green,</span>
<span class="i0">And wondering drew the shipmen round to gaze</span>
<span class="i0">Upon those limbs, the mightiest ever seen;</span>
<span class="i0">And many deemed it no light thing to face</span>
<span class="i0">The splendour of his eyen, though they did blaze</span>
<span class="i0">With no wrath now, no hate for them to dread,</span>
<span class="i0">As seaward 'twixt the summer isles they sped.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Freshened the wind, but ever fair it blew</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the south-east; but as failed the land,</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the plunging prow the Strong Man drew,</span>
<span class="i0">And silent, gazing with wide eyes did stand,</span>
<span class="i0">As though his heart found rest; but 'mid the band</span>
<span class="i0">Of shipmen in the stern the old man sat,</span>
<span class="i0">Telling them tales that no man there forgat.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">As one who had beheld, he told them there</span>
<span class="i0">Of the sweet singer, whom, for his song's sake,</span>
<span class="i0">The dolphins back from choking death did bear;</span>
<span class="i0">How in the mid sea did the vine outbreak</span>
<span class="i0">O'er that ill bark when Bacchus 'gan to wake;</span>
<span class="i0">How anigh Cyprus, ruddy with the rose</span>
<span class="i0">The cold sea grew as any June-loved close;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">While on the flowery shore all things alive</span>
<span class="i0">Grew faint with sense of birth of some delight,</span>
<span class="i0">And the nymphs waited trembling there, to give</span>
<span class="i0">Glad welcome to the glory of that sight:</span>
<span class="i0">He paused then, ere he told how, wild and white,</span>
<span class="i0">Rose ocean, breaking o'er a race accurst,</span>
<span class="i0">A world once good, now come unto its worst.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And then he smiled, and said, "And yet ye won,</span>
<span class="i0">Ye men, and tremble not on days like these,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor think with what a mind Prometheus' son</span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the last of the torn reeling trees</span>
<span class="i0">From high Parnassus: slipping through the seas</span>
<span class="i0">Ye never think, ye men-folk, how ye seem</span>
<span class="i0">From down below through the green waters' gleam."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Dusk was it now when these last words he said,</span>
<span class="i0">And little of his visage might they see,</span>
<span class="i0">But o'er their hearts stole vague and troublous dread,</span>
<span class="i0">They knew not why; yet ever quietly</span>
<span class="i0">They sailed that night; nor might a morning be</span>
<span class="i0">Fairer than was the next morn; and they went</span>
<span class="i0">Along their due course after their intent.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">The fourth day, about sunrise, from the mast</span>
<span class="i0">The watch cried out he saw Phoenician land;</span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the Strong Man on the elder cast</span>
<span class="i0">A look askance, and he straight took his stand</span>
<span class="i0">Anigh the prow, and gazed beneath his hand</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the low sun and the scarce-seen shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Till cloud-flecks rose, and gathered and drew o'er.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">The morn grown cold; then small rain 'gan to fall,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the wind dropped dead, and hearts of men</span>
<span class="i0">Sank, and their bark seemed helpless now and small;</span>
<span class="i0">Then suddenly the wind 'gan moan again;</span>
<span class="i0">Sails flapped, and ropes beat wild about; and then</span>
<span class="i0">Down came the great east wind; and the ship ran</span>
<span class="i0">Straining, heeled o'er, through seas all changed and wan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Westward, scarce knowing night from day, they drave</span>
<span class="i0">Through sea and sky grown one; the Strong Man wrought</span>
<span class="i0">With mighty hands, and seemed a god to save;</span>
<span class="i0">But on the prow, heeding all weather nought,</span>
<span class="i0">The elder stood, nor any prop he sought,</span>
<span class="i0">But swayed to the ship's wallowing, as on wings</span>
<span class="i0">He there were set above the wrack of things.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And westward still they drave; and if they saw</span>
<span class="i0">Land upon either side, as on they sped,</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas but as faces in a dream may draw</span>
<span class="i0">Anigh, and fade, and leave nought in their stead;</span>
<span class="i0">And in the shipmen's hearts grew heavy dread</span>
<span class="i0">To sick despair; they deemed they should drive on</span>
<span class="i0">Till the world's edge and empty space were won.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But 'neath the Strong Man's eyes e'en as they might</span>
<span class="i0">They toiled on still; and he sang to the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">And spread his arms to meet the waters white,</span>
<span class="i0">As o'er the deck they tumbled, making blind</span>
<span class="i0">The brine-drenched shipmen; nor with eye unkind</span>
<span class="i0">He gazed up at the lightning; nor would frown</span>
<span class="i0">When o'er the wet waste Jove's bolt rattled down.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And they, who at the last had come to think</span>
<span class="i0">Their guests were very gods, with all their fear</span>
<span class="i0">Feared nought belike that their good ship would sink</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the storm; but rather looked to hear</span>
<span class="i0">The last moan of the wind that them should bear</span>
<span class="i0">Into the windless stream of ocean grey,</span>
<span class="i0">Where they should float till dead was every day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Yet their fear mocked them; for the storm 'gan die</span>
<span class="i0">About the tenth day, though unto the west</span>
<span class="i0">They drave on still; soon fair and quietly</span>
<span class="i0">The morn would break: and though amid their rest</span>
<span class="i0">Nought but long evil wandering seemed the best</span>
<span class="i0">That they might hope for; still, despite their dread,</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet was the quiet sea and goodlihead</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Of the bright sun at last come back again;</span>
<span class="i0">And as the days passed, less and less fear grew,</span>
<span class="i0">If without cause, till faded all their pain;</span>
<span class="i0">And they 'gan turn unto their guests anew,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet durst ask nought of what that evil drew</span>
<span class="i0">Upon their heads; or of returning speak.</span>
<span class="i0">Happy they felt, but listless, spent, and weak.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And now as at the first the elder was,</span>
<span class="i0">And sat and told them tales of yore agone;</span>
<span class="i0">But ever the Strong Man up and down would pass</span>
<span class="i0">About the deck, or on the prow alone</span>
<span class="i0">Would stand and stare out westward; and still on</span>
<span class="i0">Through a fair summer sea they went, nor thought</span>
<span class="i0">Of what would come when these days turned to nought.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And now when twenty days were well passed o'er</span>
<span class="i0">They made a new land; cloudy mountains high</span>
<span class="i0">Rose from the sea at first; then a green shore</span>
<span class="i0">Spread fair below them: as they drew anigh</span>
<span class="i0">No sloping, stony strand could they espy,</span>
<span class="i0">And no surf breaking; the green sea and wide</span>
<span class="i0">Wherethrough they slipped was driven by no tide.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Dark fell ere they might set their eager feet</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the shore; but night-long their ship lay</span>
<span class="i0">As in a deep stream, by the blossoms sweet</span>
<span class="i0">That flecked the grass whence flowers ne'er passed away.</span>
<span class="i0">But when the cloud-barred east brought back the day,</span>
<span class="i0">And turned the western mountain-tops to gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Fresh fear the shipmen in their bark did hold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">For as a dream seemed all; too fair for those</span>
<span class="i0">Who needs must die; moreover they could see,</span>
<span class="i0">A furlong off, 'twixt apple-tree and rose,</span>
<span class="i0">A brazen wall that gleamed out wondrously</span>
<span class="i0">In the young sun, and seemed right long to be;</span>
<span class="i0">And memory of all marvels lay upon</span>
<span class="i0">Their shrinking hearts now this sweet place was won.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But when unto the nameless guests they turned,</span>
<span class="i0">Who stood together nigh the plank shot out</span>
<span class="i0">Shoreward, within the Strong Man's eyes there burned</span>
<span class="i0">A wild light, as the other one in doubt</span>
<span class="i0">He eyed a moment; then with a great shout</span>
<span class="i0">Leaped into the blossomed grass; the echoes rolled</span>
<span class="i0">Back from the hills, harsh still and over-bold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Slowly the old man followed him, and still</span>
<span class="i0">The crew held back: they knew now they were brought</span>
<span class="i0">Over the sea the purpose to fulfil</span>
<span class="i0">Of these strange men; and in their hearts they thought,</span>
<span class="i0">"Perchance we yet shall live, if, meddling nought</span>
<span class="i0">With dreams, we bide here till these twain come back;</span>
<span class="i0">But prying eyes the fire-blast seldom lack."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Yet 'mongst them were two fellows bold and young,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, looking each upon the other's face,</span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts to meet the unknown danger strung,</span>
<span class="i0">And went ashore, and at a gentle pace</span>
<span class="i0">Followed the strangers, who unto the place</span>
<span class="i0">Where the wall gleamed had turned; peace and desire</span>
<span class="i0">Mingled together in their hearts, as nigher</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">They drew unto that wall, and dulled their fear:</span>
<span class="i0">Fair wrought it was, as though with bricks of brass;</span>
<span class="i0">And images upon its face there were,</span>
<span class="i0">Stories of things a long while come to pass:</span>
<span class="i0">Nor that alone&mdash;as looking in a glass</span>
<span class="i0">Its maker knew the tales of what should be,</span>
<span class="i0">And wrought them there for bird and beast to see.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So on they went; the many birds sang sweet</span>
<span class="i0">Through all that blossomed thicket from above,</span>
<span class="i0">And unknown flowers bent down before their feet;</span>
<span class="i0">The very air, cleft by the grey-winged dove,</span>
<span class="i0">Throbbed with sweet scent, and smote their souls with love.</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly they went till those twain stayed before</span>
<span class="i0">A strangely-wrought and iron-covered door.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">They stayed, too, till o'er noise of wind, and bird,</span>
<span class="i0">And falling flower, there rang a mighty shout</span>
<span class="i0">As the Strong Man his steel-bound club upreared,</span>
<span class="i0">And drave it 'gainst the hammered iron stout,</span>
<span class="i0">Where 'neath his blows flew bolt and rivet out,</span>
<span class="i0">Till shattered on the ground the great door lay,</span>
<span class="i0">And into the guarded place bright poured the day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">The Strong Man entered, but his fellow stayed,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaning against a tree-trunk as they deemed.</span>
<span class="i0">They faltered now, and yet all things being weighed</span>
<span class="i0">Went on again; and thought they must have dreamed</span>
<span class="i0">Of the old man, for now the sunlight streamed</span>
<span class="i0">Full on the tree he had been leaning on,</span>
<span class="i0">And him they saw not go, yet was he gone:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Only a slim green lizard flitted there</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the dry leaves; him they noted nought,</span>
<span class="i0">But trembling, through the doorway 'gan to peer,</span>
<span class="i0">And still of strange and dreadful saw not aught,</span>
<span class="i0">Only a garden fair beyond all thought.</span>
<span class="i0">And there, 'twixt sun and shade, the Strong Man went</span>
<span class="i0">On some long-sought-for end belike intent.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">They 'gan to follow down a narrow way</span>
<span class="i0">Of green-sward that the lilies trembled o'er,</span>
<span class="i0">And whereon thick the scattered rose-leaves lay;</span>
<span class="i0">But a great wonder weighed upon them sore,</span>
<span class="i0">And well they thought they should return no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet scarce a pain that seemed; they looked to meet</span>
<span class="i0">Before they died things strange and fair and sweet.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So still to right and left the Strong Man thrust</span>
<span class="i0">The blossomed boughs, and passed on steadily,</span>
<span class="i0">As though his hardy heart he well did trust,</span>
<span class="i0">Till in a while he gave a joyous cry,</span>
<span class="i0">And hastened on, as though the end drew nigh;</span>
<span class="i0">And women's voices then they deemed they heard,</span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with a noise that made desire afeard.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Yet through sweet scents and sounds on did they bear</span>
<span class="i0">Their panting hearts, till the path ended now</span>
<span class="i0">In a wide space of green, a streamlet clear</span>
<span class="i0">From out a marble basin there did flow,</span>
<span class="i0">And close by that a slim-trunked tree did grow,</span>
<span class="i0">And on a bough low o'er the water cold</span>
<span class="i0">There hung three apples of red-gleaming gold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">About the tree, new risen e'en now to meet</span>
<span class="i0">The shining presence of that mighty one,</span>
<span class="i0">Three damsels stood, naked from head to feet</span>
<span class="i0">Save for the glory of their hair, where sun</span>
<span class="i0">And shadow flickered, while the wind did run</span>
<span class="i0">Through the grey leaves o'erhead, and shook the grass</span>
<span class="i0">Where nigh their feet the wandering bee did pass.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But 'midst their delicate limbs and all around</span>
<span class="i0">The tree-roots, gleaming blue black could they see</span>
<span class="i0">The spires of a great serpent, that, enwound</span>
<span class="i0">About the smooth bole, looked forth threateningly,</span>
<span class="i0">With glittering eyes and raised crest, o'er the three</span>
<span class="i0">Fair heads fresh crowned, and hissed above the speech</span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith they murmured softly each to each.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now the Strong Man amid the green space stayed,</span>
<span class="i0">And leaning on his club, with eager eyes</span>
<span class="i0">But brow yet smooth, in voice yet friendly said:</span>
<span class="i0">"O daughters of old Hesperus the Wise,</span>
<span class="i0">Well have ye held your guard here; but time tries</span>
<span class="i0">The very will of gods, and to my hand</span>
<span class="i0">Must give this day the gold fruit of your land."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Then spake the first maid&mdash;sweet as the west wind</span>
<span class="i0">Amidst of summer noon her sweet voice was:</span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, me! what knows this place of changing mind</span>
<span class="i0">Of men or gods; here shall long ages pass,</span>
<span class="i0">And clean forget thy feet upon the grass,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy hapless bones amid the fruitful mould;</span>
<span class="i0">Look at thy death envenomed swift and cold!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Hiding new flowers, the dull coils, as she spake,</span>
<span class="i0">Moved near her limbs: but then the second one,</span>
<span class="i0">In such a voice as when the morn doth wake</span>
<span class="i0">To song of birds, said, "When the world foredone</span>
<span class="i0">Has moaned its last, still shall we dwell alone</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath this bough, and have no tales to tell</span>
<span class="i0">Of things deemed great that on the earth befell."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Then spake the third, in voice as of the flute</span>
<span class="i0">That wakes the maiden to her wedding morn:</span>
<span class="i0">"If any god should gain our golden fruit,</span>
<span class="i0">Its curse would make his deathless life forlorn.</span>
<span class="i0">Lament thou, then, that ever thou wert born;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet all things, changed by joy or loss or pain,</span>
<span class="i0">To what they were shall change and change again."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"So be it," he said, "the Fates that drive me on</span>
<span class="i0">Shall slay me or shall save; blessing or curse</span>
<span class="i0">That followeth after when the thing is won</span>
<span class="i0">Shall make my work no better now nor worse;</span>
<span class="i0">And if it be that the world's heart must nurse</span>
<span class="i0">Hatred against me, how then shall I choose</span>
<span class="i0">To leave or take?&mdash;let your dread servant loose!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">E'en therewith, like a pillar of black smoke,</span>
<span class="i0">Swift, shifting ever, drave the worm at him;</span>
<span class="i0">In deadly silence now that nothing broke,</span>
<span class="i0">Its folds were writhing round him trunk and limb,</span>
<span class="i0">Until his glittering gear was nought but dim</span>
<span class="i0">E'en in that sunshine, while his head and side</span>
<span class="i0">And breast the fork-tongued, pointed muzzle tried.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Closer the coils drew, quicker all about</span>
<span class="i0">The forked tongue darted, and yet stiff he stood,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en as an oak that sees the straw flare out</span>
<span class="i0">And lick its ancient bole for little good:</span>
<span class="i0">Until the godlike fury of his mood</span>
<span class="i0">Burst from his heart in one great shattering cry,</span>
<span class="i0">And rattling down the loosened coils did lie;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">And from the torn throat and crushed dreadful head</span>
<span class="i0">Forth flowed a stream of blood along the grass;</span>
<span class="i0">Bright in the sun he stood above the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Panting with fury; yet as ever was</span>
<span class="i0">The wont of him, soon did his anger pass,</span>
<span class="i0">And with a happy smile at last he turned</span>
<span class="i0">To where the apples o'er the water burned.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Silent and moveless ever stood the three;</span>
<span class="i0">No change came o'er their faces, as his hand</span>
<span class="i0">Was stretched aloft unto the sacred tree;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor shrank they aught aback, though he did stand</span>
<span class="i0">So close that tresses of their bright hair, fanned</span>
<span class="i0">By the sweet garden breeze, lay light on him,</span>
<span class="i0">And his gold fell brushed by them breast and limb.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">He drew adown the wind-stirred bough, and took</span>
<span class="i0">The apples thence; then let it spring away,</span>
<span class="i0">And from his brow the dark hair backward shook,</span>
<span class="i0">And said: "O sweet, O fair, and shall this day</span>
<span class="i0">A curse upon my life henceforward lay&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This day alone? Methinks of coming life</span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat I know, with all its loss and strife.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"But this I know, at least: the world shall wend</span>
<span class="i0">Upon its way, and, gathering joy and grief</span>
<span class="i0">And deeds done, bear them with it to the end;</span>
<span class="i0">So shall it, though I lie as last year's leaf</span>
<span class="i0">Lies 'neath a summer tree, at least receive</span>
<span class="i0">My life gone by, and store it, with the gain</span>
<span class="i0">That men alive call striving, wrong, and pain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"So for my part I rather bless than curse,</span>
<span class="i0">And bless this fateful land; good be with it;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor for this deadly thing's death is it worse,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor for the lack of gold; still shall ye sit</span>
<span class="i0">Watching the swallow o'er the daisies flit;</span>
<span class="i0">Still shall your wandering limbs ere day is done</span>
<span class="i0">Make dawn desired by the sinking sun.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"And now, behold! in memory of all this</span>
<span class="i0">Take ye this girdle that shall waste and fade</span>
<span class="i0">As fadeth not your fairness and your bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">That when hereafter 'mid the blossoms laid</span>
<span class="i0">Ye talk of days and men now nothing made,</span>
<span class="i0">Ye may remember how the Theban man,</span>
<span class="i0">The son of Jove, came o'er the waters wan."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Their faces changed not aught for all they heard;</span>
<span class="i0">As though all things now fully told out were,</span>
<span class="i0">They gazed upon him without any word:</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! craving kindness, hope, or loving care,</span>
<span class="i0">Their fairness scarcely could have made more fair,</span>
<span class="i0">As with the apples folded in his fell</span>
<span class="i0">He went, to do more deeds for folk to tell.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Now as the girdle on the ground was cast</span>
<span class="i0">Those fellows turned and hurried toward the door,</span>
<span class="i0">And as across its broken leaves they passed</span>
<span class="i0">The old man saw they not, e'en as before;</span>
<span class="i0">But an unearthed blind mole bewildered sore</span>
<span class="i0">Was wandering there in fruitless, aimless wise,</span>
<span class="i0">That got small heed from their full-sated eyes.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Swift gat they to their anxious folk; nor had</span>
<span class="i0">More time than just to say, "Be of good cheer,</span>
<span class="i0">For in our own land may we yet be glad,"</span>
<span class="i0">When they beheld the guests a-drawing near;</span>
<span class="i0">And much bewildered the two fellows were</span>
<span class="i0">To see the old man, and must even deem</span>
<span class="i0">That they should see things stranger than a dream.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But when they were aboard the elder cried,</span>
<span class="i0">"Up sails, my masters, fair now is the wind;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor good it is too long here to abide,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest what ye may not loose your souls should bind."</span>
<span class="i0">And as he spake, the tall trees left behind</span>
<span class="i0">Stirred with the rising land-wind, and the crew,</span>
<span class="i0">Joyous thereat, the hawsers shipward drew.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Swift sped the ship, and glad at heart were all,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Strong Man was merry with the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the elder's lips no word did fall</span>
<span class="i0">That did not seem to promise all the best;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet with a certain awe were men oppressed,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt as if their inmost hearts were bare,</span>
<span class="i0">And each man's secret babbled through the air.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Still oft the old man sat with them and told</span>
<span class="i0">Tales of past time, as on the outward way;</span>
<span class="i0">And now would they the face of him behold</span>
<span class="i0">And deem it changed; the years that on him lay</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to grow nought, and no more wan and grey</span>
<span class="i0">He looked, but ever glorious, wise and strong,</span>
<span class="i0">As though no lapse of time for him were long.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">At last, when six days through the kindly sea</span>
<span class="i0">Their keel had slipped, he said: "Come hearken now,</span>
<span class="i0">For so it is that things fare wondrously</span>
<span class="i0">E'en in these days; and I a tale can show</span>
<span class="i0">That, told by you unto your sons shall grow</span>
<span class="i0">A marvel of the days that are to come:</span>
<span class="i0">Take heed and tell it when ye reach your home.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Yet living in the world a man there is</span>
<span class="i0">Men call the Theban King Amphitryon's son,</span>
<span class="i0">Although perchance a greater sire was his;</span>
<span class="i0">But certainly his lips have hung upon</span>
<span class="i0">Alcmena's breasts: great deeds this man hath won</span>
<span class="i0">Already, for his name is Hercules,</span>
<span class="i0">And e'en ye Asian folk have heard of these.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Now ere the moon, this eve in his last wane,</span>
<span class="i0">Was born, this Hercules, the fated thrall</span>
<span class="i0">Of King Eurystheus, was straight bid to gain</span>
<span class="i0">Gifts from a land whereon no foot doth fall</span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal man, beyond the misty wall</span>
<span class="i0">Of unknown waters; pensively he went</span>
<span class="i0">Along the sea on his hard life intent.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"And at the dawn he came into a bay</span>
<span class="i0">Where the sea, ebbed far down, left wastes of sand,</span>
<span class="i0">Walled from the green earth by great cliffs and grey;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he looked up, and wondering there did stand,</span>
<span class="i0">For strange things lay in slumber on the strand;</span>
<span class="i0">Strange counterparts of what the firm earth hath</span>
<span class="i0">Lay scattered all about his weary path:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Sea-lions and sea-horses and sea-kine,</span>
<span class="i0">Sea-boars, sea-men strange-skinned, of wondrous hair;</span>
<span class="i0">And in their midst a man who seemed divine</span>
<span class="i0">For changeless eld, and round him women fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Clad in the sea-webs glassy green and clear</span>
<span class="i0">With gems on head and girdle, limb and breast,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as earth knoweth not among her best.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"A moment at the fair and wondrous sight</span>
<span class="i0">He stared, then, since the heart in him was good,</span>
<span class="i0">He went about with careful steps and light</span>
<span class="i0">Till o'er the sleeping sea-god now he stood;</span>
<span class="i0">And if the white-foot maids had stirred his blood</span>
<span class="i0">As he passed by, now other thoughts had place</span>
<span class="i0">Within his heart when he beheld that face.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"For Nereus now he knew, who knows all things;</span>
<span class="i0">And to himself he said, 'If I prevail,</span>
<span class="i0">Better than by some god-wrought eagle-wings</span>
<span class="i0">Shall I be holpen;' then he cried out: 'Hail,</span>
<span class="i0">O Nereus! lord of shifting hill and dale!</span>
<span class="i0">Arise and wrestle; I am Hercules!</span>
<span class="i0">Not soon now shalt thou meet the ridgy seas.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"And mightily he cast himself on him;</span>
<span class="i0">And Nereus cried out shrilly; and straightway</span>
<span class="i0">That sleeping crowd, fair maid with half-hid limb,</span>
<span class="i0">Strange man and green-haired beast, made no delay,</span>
<span class="i0">But glided down into the billows grey,</span>
<span class="i0">And, by the lovely sea embraced, were gone,</span>
<span class="i0">While they two wrestled on the sea strand lone.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Soon found the sea-god that his bodily might</span>
<span class="i0">Was nought in dealing with Jove's dear one there;</span>
<span class="i0">And soon he 'gan to use his magic sleight:</span>
<span class="i0">Into a lithe leopard, and a hugging bear</span>
<span class="i0">He turned him; then the smallest fowl of air</span>
<span class="i0">The straining arms of Hercules must hold,</span>
<span class="i0">And then a mud-born wriggling eel and cold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Then as the firm hands mastered this, forth brake</span>
<span class="i0">A sudden rush of waters all around,</span>
<span class="i0">Blinding and choking: then a thin green snake</span>
<span class="i0">With golden eyes; then o'er the shell-strewn ground</span>
<span class="i0">Forth stole a fly the least that may be found;</span>
<span class="i0">Then earth and heaven seemed wrapped in one huge flame,</span>
<span class="i0">But from the midst thereof a voice there came:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"'Kinsman and stout-heart, thou hast won the day,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor to my grief: what wouldst thou have of me?'</span>
<span class="i0">And therewith to an old man small and grey</span>
<span class="i0">Faded the roaring flame, who wearily</span>
<span class="i0">Sat down upon the sand and said, 'Let be!</span>
<span class="i0">I know thy tale; worthy of help thou art;</span>
<span class="i0">Come now, a short way hence will there depart</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"'A ship of Tyre for the warm southern seas,</span>
<span class="i0">Come we a-board; according to my will</span>
<span class="i0">Her way shall be.' Then up rose Hercules,</span>
<span class="i0">Merry of face, though hot and panting still;</span>
<span class="i0">But the fair summer day his heart did fill</span>
<span class="i0">With all delight; and so forth went the twain,</span>
<span class="i0">And found those men desirous of all gain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Ah, for these gainful men&mdash;somewhat indeed</span>
<span class="i0">Their sails are rent, their bark beat; kin and friend</span>
<span class="i0">Are wearying for them; yet a friend in need</span>
<span class="i0">They yet shall gain, if at their journey's end,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the last ness where the wild goats wend</span>
<span class="i0">To lick the salt-washed stones, a house they raise</span>
<span class="i0">Bedight with gold in kindly Nereus' praise."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Breathless they waited for these latest words,</span>
<span class="i0">That like the soft wind of the gathering night</span>
<span class="i0">Were grown to be: about the mast flew birds</span>
<span class="i0">Making their moan, hovering long-winged and white;</span>
<span class="i0">And now before their straining anxious sight</span>
<span class="i0">The old man faded out into the air,</span>
<span class="i0">And from his place flew forth a sea-mew fair.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Then to the Mighty Man, Alcmena's son,</span>
<span class="i0">With yearning hearts they turned till he should speak,</span>
<span class="i0">And he spake softly: "Nought ill have ye done</span>
<span class="i0">In helping me to find what I did seek:</span>
<span class="i0">The world made better by me knows if weak</span>
<span class="i0">My hand and heart are: but now, light the fire</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the prow and worship the grey sire."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So did they; and such gifts as there they had</span>
<span class="i0">Gave unto Nereus; yea, and sooth to say,</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the tumult of their hearts made glad,</span>
<span class="i0">Had honoured Hercules in e'en such way;</span>
<span class="i0">But he laughed out amid them, and said, "Nay,</span>
<span class="i0">Not yet the end is come; nor have I yet</span>
<span class="i0">Bowed down before vain longing and regret.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"It may be&mdash;who shall tell, when I go back</span>
<span class="i0">There whence I came, and looking down behold</span>
<span class="i0">The place that my once eager heart shall lack,</span>
<span class="i0">And all my dead desires a-lying cold,</span>
<span class="i0">But I may have the might then to enfold</span>
<span class="i0">The hopes of brave men in my heart?&mdash;but long</span>
<span class="i0">Life lies before first with its change and wrong."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">So fair along the watery ways they sped</span>
<span class="i0">In happy wise, nor failed of their return;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor failed in ancient Tyre the ways to tread,</span>
<span class="i0">Teaching their tale to whomsoever would learn,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor failed at last the flesh of beasts to burn</span>
<span class="i0">In Nereus' house, turned toward the bright day's end</span>
<span class="i0">On the last ness, round which the wild goats wend.</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Here are we for the last time face to face,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou and I, Book, before I bid thee speed</span>
<span class="i0">Upon thy perilous journey to that place</span>
<span class="i0">For which I have done on thee pilgrim's weed,</span>
<span class="i0">Striving to get thee all things for thy need&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I love thee, whatso time or men may say</span>
<span class="i0">Of the poor singer of an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Good reason why I love thee, e'en if thou</span>
<span class="i0">Be mocked or clean forgot as time wears on;</span>
<span class="i0">For ever as thy fashioning did grow,</span>
<span class="i0">Kind word and praise because of thee I won</span>
<span class="i0">From those without whom were my world all gone,</span>
<span class="i0">My hope fallen dead, my singing cast away,</span>
<span class="i0">And I set soothly in an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">I love thee; yet this last time must it be,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou must hold thy peace and I must speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest if thou babble I begin to see</span>
<span class="i0">Thy gear too thin, thy limbs and heart too weak,</span>
<span class="i0">To find the land thou goest forth to seek&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Though what harm if thou die upon the way,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou idle singer of an empty day?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">But though this land desired thou never reach,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet folk who know it mayst thou meet or death;</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore a word unto thee would I teach</span>
<span class="i0">To answer these, who, noting thy weak breath,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy wandering eyes, thy heart of little faith,</span>
<span class="i0">May make thy fond desire a sport and play,</span>
<span class="i0">Mocking the singer of an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">That land's name, say'st thou? and the road thereto?</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, Book, thou mockest, saying thou know'st it not;</span>
<span class="i0">Surely no book of verse I ever knew</span>
<span class="i0">But ever was the heart within him hot</span>
<span class="i0">To gain the Land of Matters Unforgot&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;There, now we both laugh&mdash;as the whole world may,</span>
<span class="i0">At us poor singers of an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Nay, let it pass, and hearken! Hast thou heard</span>
<span class="i0">That therein I believe I have a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Of whom for love I may not be afeard?</span>
<span class="i0">It is to him indeed I bid thee wend;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, he perchance may meet thee ere thou end,</span>
<span class="i0">Dying so far off from the hedge of bay,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou idle singer of an empty day!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Well, think of him, I bid thee, on the road,</span>
<span class="i0">And if it hap that midst of thy defeat,</span>
<span class="i0">Fainting beneath thy follies' heavy load,</span>
<span class="i0">My Master, <span class="smcap">Geoffrey Chaucer</span>, thou do meet,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shalt thou win a space of rest full sweet;</span>
<span class="i0">Then be thou bold, and speak the words I say,</span>
<span class="i0">The idle singer of an empty day!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"O Master, O thou great of heart and tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou well mayst ask me why I wander here,</span>
<span class="i0">In raiment rent of stories oft besung!</span>
<span class="i0">But of thy gentleness draw thou anear,</span>
<span class="i0">And then the heart of one who held thee dear</span>
<span class="i0">Mayst thou behold! So near as that I lay</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the singer of an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"For this he ever said, who sent me forth</span>
<span class="i0">To seek a place amid thy company;</span>
<span class="i0">That howsoever little was my worth,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet was he worth e'en just so much as I;</span>
<span class="i0">He said that rhyme hath little skill to lie:</span>
<span class="i0">Nor feigned to cast his worser part away</span>
<span class="i0">In idle singing for an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"I have beheld him tremble oft enough</span>
<span class="i0">At things he could not choose but trust to me,</span>
<span class="i0">Although he knew the world was wise and rough:</span>
<span class="i0">And never did he fail to let me see</span>
<span class="i0">His love,&mdash;his folly and faithlessness, may be;</span>
<span class="i0">And still in turn I gave him voice to pray</span>
<span class="i0">Such prayers as cling about an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Thou, keen-eyed, reading me, mayst read him through,</span>
<span class="i0">For surely little is there left behind;</span>
<span class="i0">No power great deeds unnameable to do;</span>
<span class="i0">No knowledge for which words he may not find,</span>
<span class="i0">No love of things as vague as autumn wind&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Earth of the earth lies hidden by my clay,</span>
<span class="i0">The idle singer of an empty day!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Children we twain are, saith he, late made wise</span>
<span class="i0">In love, but in all else most childish still,</span>
<span class="i0">And seeking still the pleasure of our eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And what our ears with sweetest sounds may fill;</span>
<span class="i0">Not fearing Love, lest these things he should kill;</span>
<span class="i0">Howe'er his pain by pleasure doth he lay,</span>
<span class="i0">Making a strange tale of an empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"Death have we hated, knowing not what it meant;</span>
<span class="i0">Life have we loved, through green leaf and through sere,</span>
<span class="i0">Though still the less we knew of its intent:</span>
<span class="i0">The Earth and Heaven through countless year on year,</span>
<span class="i0">Slow changing, were to us but curtains fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Hung round about a little room, where play</span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and laughter of man's empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">"O Master, if thine heart could love us yet,</span>
<span class="i0">Spite of things left undone, and wrongly done,</span>
<span class="i0">Some place in loving hearts then should we get,</span>
<span class="i0">For thou, sweet-souled, didst never stand alone,</span>
<span class="i0">But knew'st the joy and woe of many an one&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;By lovers dead, who live through thee we pray,</span>
<span class="i0">Help thou us singers of an empty day!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Fearest thou, Book, what answer thou mayst gain</span>
<span class="i0">Lest he should scorn thee, and thereof thou die?</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, it shall not be.&mdash;Thou mayst toil in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">And never draw the House of Fame anigh;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet he and his shall know whereof we cry,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall call it not ill done to strive to lay</span>
<span class="i0">The ghosts that crowd about life's empty day.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i2">Then let the others go! and if indeed</span>
<span class="i0">In some old garden thou and I have wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">And made fresh flowers spring up from hoarded seed,</span>
<span class="i0">And fragrance of old days and deeds have brought</span>
<span class="i0">Back to folk weary; all was not for nought.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;No little part it was for me to play&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The idle singer of an empty day.</span>

<h3>FROM</h3>

<h2>"THE STORY OF SIGURD THE VOLSUNG."</h2>

<h3>BOOK II.</h3>

<h2><a name="REGIN" id="REGIN"></a>R E G I N.</h2>


<p>Now this is the first book of the life and death of Sigurd the Volsung,
and therein is told of the birth of him, and of his dealings with Regin
the master of masters, and of his deeds in the waste places of the
earth.</p>

<h3><i>Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund.</i></h3>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Peace</span> lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son;</span>
<span class="i0">There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done,</span>
<span class="i0">And glad was the dawn's awakening, and the noontide fair and glad:</span>
<span class="i0">There no great store had the franklin, and enough the hireling had;</span>
<span class="i0">And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land</span>
<span class="i0">With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand.</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a country of cunning craftsmen, and many a thing they wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">That the lands of storm desired, and the homes of warfare sought.</span>
<span class="i0">But men deemed it o'er-well warded by more than its stems of fight,</span>
<span class="i0">And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might.</span>
<span class="i0">So hidden was that country, and few men sailed its sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk's company.</span>
<span class="i0">But fair-fruited, many-peopled, it lies a goodly strip,</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood's surging lip,</span>
<span class="i0">And a perilous flood is its ocean, and its mountains, who shall tell</span>
<span class="i0">What things in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may dwell.</span>
<span class="i0">Now a man of the Kings, called Gripir, in this land of peace abode:</span>
<span class="i0">The son of the Helper's father, though never lay his load</span>
<span class="i0">In the womb of the mother of Kings that the Helper's brethren bore;</span>
<span class="i0">But of Giant kin was his mother, of the folk that are seen no more;</span>
<span class="i0">Though whiles as ye ride some fell-road across the heath there comes</span>
<span class="i0">The voice of their lone lamenting o'er their changed and conquered homes.</span>
<span class="i0">A long way off from the sea-strand and beneath the mountains' feet</span>
<span class="i0">Is the high-built hall of Gripir, where the waste and the tillage meet;</span>
<span class="i0">A noble and plentiful house, that a little men-folk fear,</span>
<span class="i0">But beloved of the crag-dwelling eagles and the kin of the woodland deer.</span>
<span class="i0">A man of few words was Gripir, but he knew of all deeds that had been,</span>
<span class="i0">And times there came upon him, when the deeds to be were seen:</span>
<span class="i0">No sword had he held in his hand since his father fell to field,</span>
<span class="i0">And against the life of the slayer he bore undinted shield:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet no fear in his heart abided, nor desired he aught at all,</span>
<span class="i0">But he noted the deeds that had been, and looked for what should befall.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Again, in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man</span>
<span class="i0">Beardless and low of stature, of visage pinched and wan:</span>
<span class="i0">So exceeding old was Regin, that no son of man could tell</span>
<span class="i0">In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">But the youth of King Elf had he fostered, and the Helper's youth thereto,</span>
<span class="i0">Yes and his father's father's: the lore of all men he knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And was deft in every cunning, save the dealings of the sword:</span>
<span class="i0">So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned, that men trowed his every word;</span>
<span class="i0">His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight</span>
<span class="i0">With the latter days of sorrow; all tales he told aright;</span>
<span class="i0">The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he;</span>
<span class="i0">And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor might any learn him leech-craft, for before that race was made,</span>
<span class="i0">And that man-folk's generation, all their life-days had he weighed.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">In this land abideth Hiordis amid all people's praise</span>
<span class="i0">Till cometh the time appointed: in the fulness of the days</span>
<span class="i0">Through the dark and the dusk she travailed, till at last in the dawning hour</span>
<span class="i0">Have the deeds of the Volsungs blossomed, and born their latest flower;</span>
<span class="i0">In the bed there lieth a man child, and his eyes look straight on the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And lo, the hope of the people, and the days of a king are begun.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Men say of the serving-women, when they cried on the joy of the morn,</span>
<span class="i0">When they handled the linen raiment, and washed the king new-born,</span>
<span class="i0">When they bore him back unto Hiordis, and the weary and happy breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade her be glad to behold it, how the best was sprung from the best,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet they shrank in their rejoicing before the eyes of the child,</span>
<span class="i0">So bright and dreadful were they; yea though the spring morn smiled,</span>
<span class="i0">And a thousand birds were singing round the fair familiar home,</span>
<span class="i0">And still as on other mornings they saw folk go and come,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet the hour seemed awful to them, and the hearts within them burned</span>
<span class="i0">As though of fateful matters their souls were newly learned.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Hiordis looked on the Volsung, on her grief and her fond desire,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hope of her heart was quickened, and her joy was a living fire;</span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "Now one of the earthly on the eyes of my child hath gazed</span>
<span class="i0">Nor shrunk before their glory, nor stayed her love amazed:</span>
<span class="i0">I behold thee as Sigmund beholdeth,&mdash;and I was the home of thine heart&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Woe's me for the day when thou wert not, and the hour when we shall part!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then she held him a little season on her weary and happy breast</span>
<span class="i0">And she told him of Sigmund and Volsung and the best sprung forth from the best:</span>
<span class="i0">She spake to the new-born baby as one who might understand,</span>
<span class="i0">And told him of Sigmund's battle, and the dead by the sea-flood's strand,</span>
<span class="i0">And of all the wars passed over, and the light with darkness blent.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So she spake, and the sun rose higher, and her speech at last was spent,</span>
<span class="i0">And she gave him back to the women to bear forth to the people's kings,</span>
<span class="i0">That they too may rejoice in her glory and her day of happy things.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But there sat the Helper of Men with King Elf and Earls in the hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And they spake of the deeds that had been, and told of the times to befall,</span>
<span class="i0">And they hearkened and heard sweet voices and the sound of harps draw nigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Till their hearts were exceeding merry and they knew not wherefore or why:</span>
<span class="i0">Then, lo, in the hall white raiment, as thither the damsels came,</span>
<span class="i0">And amid the hands of the foremost was the woven gold aflame.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O daughters of earls," said the Helper, "what tidings then do ye bear?</span>
<span class="i0">Is it grief in the merry morning, or joy or wonder or fear?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Quoth the first: "It is grief for the foemen that the Masters of God-home would grieve."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said the next: "'Tis a wonder of wonders, that the hearkening world shall believe."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"A fear of all fears," said the third, "for the sword is uplifted on men."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"A joy of all joys," said the fourth, "once come, it comes not again!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Lo, son," said the ancient Helper, "glad sit the earls and the lords!</span>
<span class="i0">Lookst thou not for a token of tidings to follow such-like words?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Saith King Elf: "Great words of women! or great hath our dwelling become."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said the women: "Words shall be greater, when all folk shall praise our home."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What then hath betid," said King Elf, "do the high Gods stand in our gate?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nay," said they, "else were we silent, and they should be telling of fate."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Is the bidding come," said the Helper, "that we wend the Gods to see?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Many summers and winters," they said, "ye shall live on the earth, it may be."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said a young man: "Will ye be telling that all we shall die no more?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nay," they answered, "nay, who knoweth but the change may be hard at the door?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Come ships from the sea," said an elder, "with all gifts of the Eastland gold?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Was there less than enough," said the women, "when last our treasure was told?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Speak then," said the ancient Helper, "let the worst and the best be said."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Quoth they: "'Tis the Queen of the Isle-folk, she is weary-sick on her bed."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said King Elf: "Yet ye come rejoicing; what more lieth under the tongue?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">They said: "The earth is weary; but the tender blade hath sprung,</span>
<span class="i0">That shall wax till beneath its branches fair bloom the meadows green;</span>
<span class="i0">For the Gods and they that were mighty were glad erewhile with the Queen."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said King Elf: "How say ye, women? Of a King new-born do ye tell</span>
<span class="i0">By a God of the Heavens begotten in our fathers' house to dwell?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"By a God of the Earth," they answered; "but greater yet is the son,</span>
<span class="i0">Though long were the days of Sigmund, and great are the deeds he hath done."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then she with the golden burden to the kingly high-seat stepped</span>
<span class="i0">And away from the new-born baby the purple cloths she swept,</span>
<span class="i0">And cried: "O King of the people, long mayst thou live in bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">As our hearts to-day are happy! Queen Hiordis sends thee this,</span>
<span class="i0">And she saith that the world shall call it by the name that thou shalt name;</span>
<span class="i0">Now the gift to thee is given, and to thee is brought the fame."</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then e'en as a man astonied King Elf the Volsung took,</span>
<span class="i0">While his feast-hall's ancient timbers with the cry of the earl-folk shook;</span>
<span class="i0">For the eyes of the child gleamed on him till he was as one who sees</span>
<span class="i0">The very Gods arising mid their carven images:</span>
<span class="i0">To his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind</span>
<span class="i0">And the tramp of fierce-eyed warriors through the outland forest blind;</span>
<span class="i0">The sound of hosts of battle, cries round the hoisted shield,</span>
<span class="i0">Low talk of the gathered wise-ones in the Goth-folk's holy field:</span>
<span class="i0">So the thought in a little moment through King Elf the Mighty ran</span>
<span class="i0">Of the years and their building and burden, and toil of the sons of man,</span>
<span class="i0">The joy of folk and their sorrow, and the hope of deeds to do:</span>
<span class="i0">With the love of many peoples was the wise king smitten through,</span>
<span class="i0">As he hung o'er the new-born Volsung: but at last he raised his head,</span>
<span class="i0">And looked forth kind o'er his people, and spake aloud and said:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O Sigmund King of Battle; O man of many days,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom I saw mid the shields of the fallen and the dead men's silent praise,</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how hath the dark tide perished and the dawn of day begun!</span>
<span class="i0">And now, O mighty Sigmund, wherewith shall we name thy son?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But there rose up a man most ancient, and he cried: "Hail Dawn of the Day!</span>
<span class="i0">How many things shalt thou quicken, how many shalt thou slay!</span>
<span class="i0">How many things shalt thou waken, how many lull to sleep!</span>
<span class="i0">How many things shalt thou scatter, how many gather and keep!</span>
<span class="i0">O me, how thy love shall cherish, how thine hate shall wither and burn!</span>
<span class="i0">How the hope shall be sped from thy right hand, nor the fear to thy left return!</span>
<span class="i0">O thy deeds that men shall sing of! O thy deeds that the Gods shall see!</span>
<span class="i0">O SIGURD, Son of the Volsungs, O Victory yet to be!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Men heard the name and they knew it, and they caught it up in the air,</span>
<span class="i0">And it went abroad by the windows and the doors of the feast-hall fair,</span>
<span class="i0">It went through street and market; o'er meadow and acre it went,</span>
<span class="i0">And over the wind-stirred forest and the dearth of the sea-beat bent,</span>
<span class="i0">And over the sea-flood's welter, till the folk of the fishers heard,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of the isle-abiders on the sun-scorched rocks were stirred.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But the Queen in her golden chamber, the name she hearkened and knew;</span>
<span class="i0">And she heard the flock of the women, as back to the chamber they drew,</span>
<span class="i0">And the name of Sigurd entered, and the body of Sigurd was come,</span>
<span class="i0">And it was as if Sigmund were living and she still in her lovely home;</span>
<span class="i0">Of all folk of the world was she well, and a soul fulfilled of rest</span>
<span class="i0">As alone in the chamber she wakened and Sigurd cherished her breast.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But men feast in the merry noontide, and glad is the April green</span>
<span class="i0">That a Volsung looks on the sunlight and the night and the darkness have been.</span>
<span class="i0">Earls think of marvellous stories, and along the golden strings</span>
<span class="i0">Flit words of banded brethren and names of war-fain Kings:</span>
<span class="i0">All the days of the deeds of Sigmund who was born so long ago;</span>
<span class="i0">All deeds of the glorious Signy, and her tarrying-tide of woe;</span>
<span class="i0">Men tell of the years of Volsung, and how long agone it was</span>
<span class="i0">That he changed his life in battle, and brought the tale to pass:</span>
<span class="i0">Then goeth the word of the Giants, and the world seems waxen old</span>
<span class="i0">For the dimness of King Rerir and the tale of his warfare told:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet unhushed are the singers' voices, nor yet the harp-strings cease</span>
<span class="i0">While yet is left a rumour of the mirk-wood's broken peace,</span>
<span class="i0">And of Sigi the very ancient, and the unnamed Sons of God,</span>
<span class="i0">Of the days when the Lords of Heaven full oft the world-ways trod.</span>
&nbsp;

<h4><i>Sigurd getteth to him the horse that is called Greyfell.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now waxeth the son of Sigmund in might and goodliness,</span>
<span class="i0">And soft the days win over, and all men his beauty bless.</span>
<span class="i0">But amidst the summer season was the Isle-queen Hiordis wed</span>
<span class="i0">To King Elf the son of the Helper, and fair their life-days sped.</span>
<span class="i0">Peace lay on the land for ever, and the fields gave good increase,</span>
<span class="i0">And there was Sigurd waxing mid the plenty and the peace.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Now hath the child grown greater, and is keen and eager of wit</span>
<span class="i0">And full of understanding, and oft hath the joy to sit</span>
<span class="i0">Amid talk of weighty matters when the wise men meet for speech;</span>
<span class="i0">And joyous he is moreover and blithe and kind with each.</span>
<span class="i0">But Regin the wise craftsmaster heedeth the youngling well,</span>
<span class="i0">And before the Kings he cometh, and saith such words to tell.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I have fostered thy youth, King Elf, and thine O Helper of men,</span>
<span class="i0">And ye wot that such a master no king shall see again;</span>
<span class="i0">And now would I foster Sigurd; for, though he be none of thy blood,</span>
<span class="i0">Mine heart of his days that shall be speaketh abundant good."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the Helper of men-folk: "Yea, do herein thy will:</span>
<span class="i0">For thou art the Master of Masters, and hast learned me all my skill:</span>
<span class="i0">But think how bright is this youngling, and thy guile from him withhold;</span>
<span class="i0">For this craft of thine hath shown me that thy heart is grim and cold,</span>
<span class="i0">Though three men's lives thrice over thy wisdom might not learn;</span>
<span class="i0">And I love this son of Sigmund, and mine heart to him doth yearn."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin laughed, and answered: "I doled out cunning to thee;</span>
<span class="i0">But nought with him will I measure: yet no cold-heart shall he be,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor grim, nor evil-natured: for whate'er my will might frame,</span>
<span class="i0">Gone forth is the word of the Norns, that abideth ever the same.</span>
<span class="i0">And now, despite my cunning, how deem ye I shall die?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And they said he would live as he listed, and at last in peace should lie</span>
<span class="i0">When he listed to live no longer; so mighty and wise he was.</span>
<span class="i0">But again he laughed and answered: "One day it shall come to pass,</span>
<span class="i0">That a beardless youth shall slay me: I know the fateful doom;</span>
<span class="i0">But nought may I withstand it, as it heaves up dim through the gloom."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So is Sigurd now with Regin, and he learns him many things;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all save the craft of battle, that men learned the sons of kings:</span>
<span class="i0">The smithying sword and war-coat; the carving runes aright;</span>
<span class="i0">The tongues of many countries, and soft speech for men's delight;</span>
<span class="i0">The dealing with the harp-strings, and the winding ways of song.</span>
<span class="i0">So wise of heart waxed Sigurd, and of body wondrous strong:</span>
<span class="i0">And he chased the deer of the forest, and many a wood-wolf slew,</span>
<span class="i0">And many a bull of the mountains: and the desert dales he knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heaths that the wind sweeps over; and seaward would he fare,</span>
<span class="i0">Far out from the outer skerries, and alone the sea-wights dare.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">On a day he sat with Regin amidst the unfashioned gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And the silver grey from the furnace; and Regin spake and told</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet tales of the days that have been, and the Kings of the bold and wise;</span>
<span class="i0">Till the lad's heart swelled with longing and lit his sunbright eyes.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin looked upon him: "Thou too shalt one day ride</span>
<span class="i0">As the Volsung Kings went faring through the noble world and wide.</span>
<span class="i0">For this land is nought and narrow, and Kings of the carles are these,</span>
<span class="i0">And their earls are acre-biders, and their hearts are dull with peace."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Sigurd knit his brows, and in wrathful wise he said:</span>
<span class="i0">"Ill words of those thou speakest that my youth have cherished,</span>
<span class="i0">And the friends that have made me merry, and the land that is fair and good."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin laughed and answered: "Nay, well I see by thy mood</span>
<span class="i0">That wide wilt thou ride in the world like thy kin of the earlier days:</span>
<span class="i0">And wilt thou be wroth with thy master that he longs for thy winning the praise?</span>
<span class="i0">And now if the sooth thou sayest, that these King-folk cherish thee well,</span>
<span class="i0">Then let them give thee a gift whereof the world shall tell:</span>
<span class="i0">Yea hearken to this my counsel, and crave for a battle-steed."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Yet wroth was the lad and answered: "I have many a horse to my need,</span>
<span class="i0">And all that the heart desireth, and what wouldst thou wish me more?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin answered and said: "Thy kin of the Kings of yore</span>
<span class="i0">Were the noblest men of men-folk; and their hearts would never rest</span>
<span class="i0">Whatso of good they had gotten, if their hands held not the best.</span>
<span class="i0">Now do thou after my counsel, and crave of thy fosterers here</span>
<span class="i0">That thou choose of the horses of Gripir whichso thine heart holds dear."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">He spake and his harp was with him, and he smote the strings full sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">And sang of the host of the Valkyrs, how they ride the battle to meet,</span>
<span class="i0">And the dew from the dear manes drippeth as they ride in the first of the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And the tree-boughs open to meet it when the wind of the dawning is done:</span>
<span class="i0">And the deep dales drink its sweetness and spring into blossoming grass,</span>
<span class="i0">And the earth groweth fruitful of men, and bringeth their glory to pass.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then the wrath ran off from Sigurd, and he left the smithying stead</span>
<span class="i0">While the song yet rang in the doorway: and that eve to the Kings he said:</span>
<span class="i0">"Will ye do so much for mine asking as to give me a horse to my will?</span>
<span class="i0">For belike the days shall come, that shall all my heart fulfill,</span>
<span class="i0">And teach me the deeds of a king."</span>
<span class="i8">Then answered King Elf and spake:</span>
<span class="i0">"The stalls of the Kings are before thee to set aside or to take,</span>
<span class="i0">And nought we begrudge thee the best."</span>
<span class="i8">Yet answered Sigurd again;</span>
<span class="i0">For his heart of the mountains aloft and the windy drift was fain:</span>
<span class="i0">"Fair seats for the knees of Kings! but now do I ask for a gift</span>
<span class="i0">Such as all the world shall be praising, the best of the strong and the swift.</span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall give me a token for Gripir, and bid him to let me choose</span>
<span class="i0">From out of the noble stud-beasts that run in his meadow loose.</span>
<span class="i0">But if overmuch I have asked you, forget this prayer of mine,</span>
<span class="i0">And deem the word unspoken, and get ye to the wine."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then smiled King Elf, and answered: "A long way wilt thou ride,</span>
<span class="i0">To where unpeace and troubles and the griefs of the soul abide,</span>
<span class="i0">Yea unto the death at the last: yet surely shalt thou win</span>
<span class="i0">The praise of many a people: so have thy way herein.</span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold</span>
<span class="i0">The sun of the early dawning, that turneth it all unto gold."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them; and through the night he lay</span>
<span class="i0">Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he shook the sleep from off him, and that dwelling of Kings he left</span>
<span class="i0">And wended his ways unto Gripir. On a crag from the mountain reft</span>
<span class="i0">Was the house of the old King builded; and a mighty house it was,</span>
<span class="i0">Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass:</span>
<span class="i0">But the wild ernes cried about it, and the vultures toward it flew,</span>
<span class="i0">And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber through,</span>
<span class="i0">And about were meads wide-spreading; and many a beast thereon,</span>
<span class="i0">Yea some that are men-folk's terror, their sport and pasture won.</span>
<span class="i0">So into the hall went Sigurd; and amidst was Gripir set</span>
<span class="i0">In a chair of the sea-beast's tooth; and his sweeping beard nigh met</span>
<span class="i0">The floor that was green as the ocean, and his gown was of mountain-gold</span>
<span class="i0">And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Now the first of the twain spake Gripir: "Hail King with the eyen bright!</span>
<span class="i0">Nought needest thou show the token, for I know of thy life and thy light.</span>
<span class="i0">And no need to tell of thy message; it was wafted here on the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou wouldst be coming to-day a horse in my meadow to find:</span>
<span class="i0">And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall be.</span>
<span class="i0">Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my lea,</span>
<span class="i0">And be glad as thine heart will have thee and the fate that leadeth thee on,</span>
<span class="i0">And I bid thee again come hither when the sword of worth is won,</span>
<span class="i0">And thy loins are girt for thy going on the road that before thee lies;</span>
<span class="i0">For a glimmering over its darkness is come before mine eyes."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then again gat Sigurd outward, and adown the steep he ran</span>
<span class="i0">And unto the horse-fed meadow: but lo, a grey-clad man,</span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming-ancient, there met him by the way:</span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Thou hastest, Sigurd; yet tarry till I say</span>
<span class="i0">A word that shall well bestead thee: for I know of these mountains well</span>
<span class="i0">And all the lea of Gripir, and the beasts that thereon dwell."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings? art thou Gripir's horse-herd then?</span>
<span class="i0">Nay sure, for thy face is shining like battle-eager men</span>
<span class="i0">My master Regin tells of: and I love thy cloud-grey gown</span>
<span class="i0">And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind," then spake that elder of days,</span>
<span class="i0">"And sooth do the sages say, when the beasts of my breeding they praise.</span>
<span class="i0">There is one thereof in the meadow, and, wouldst thou cull him out,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt follow an elder's counsel, who hath brought strange things about,</span>
<span class="i0">Who hath known thy father aforetime, and other kings of thy kin."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So Sigurd said, "I am ready; and what is the deed to win?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">He said: "We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side,</span>
<span class="i0">That cometh forth from the mountains, and note what next shall betide."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then the twain sped on together, and they drave the horses on</span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to a rushing river a water wide and wan;</span>
<span class="i0">And the white mews hovered o'er it; but none might hear their cry</span>
<span class="i0">For the rush and the rattle of waters, as the downlong flood swept by.</span>
<span class="i0">So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem,</span>
<span class="i0">And many a brave steed was there; but the flood o'ermastered them:</span>
<span class="i0">And some, it swept them down-ward, and some won back to bank,</span>
<span class="i0">Some, caught by the net of the eddies, in the swirling hubbub sank;</span>
<span class="i0">But one of all swam over, and they saw his mane of grey</span>
<span class="i0">Toss over the flowery meadows, a bright thing far away:</span>
<span class="i0">Wide then he wheeled about them, then took the stream again</span>
<span class="i0">And with the waves' white horses mingled his cloudy mane.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the elder of days: "Hearken now, Sigurd, and hear;</span>
<span class="i0">Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear,</span>
<span class="i0">And this horse is a gift of my giving:&mdash;heed nought where thou mayst ride:</span>
<span class="i0">For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide,</span>
<span class="i0">And on earth they thought of its threshold, and the gifts I had to give;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor prayed for a little longer, and a little longer to live."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then forth he strode to the mountains, and fain was Sigurd now</span>
<span class="i0">To ask him many a matter: but dim did his bright shape grow,</span>
<span class="i0">As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night;</span>
<span class="i0">And the sun in the high-noon shone, and the world was exceeding bright.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand,</span>
<span class="i0">And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland,</span>
<span class="i0">And the youngling looks upon him, and deems none beside him good.</span>
<span class="i0">And indeed, as tells the story, he was come of Sleipnir's blood,</span>
<span class="i0">The tireless horse of Odin: cloud-grey he was of hue,</span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund's son he knew,</span>
<span class="i0">So glad he went beneath him. Then the youngling's song arose</span>
<span class="i0">As he brushed through the noon-tide blossoms of Gripir's mighty close,</span>
<span class="i0">Then he singeth the song of Greyfell, the horse that Odin gave,</span>
<span class="i0">Who swam through the sweeping river, and back through the toppling wave.</span>
</div></div>

<h4><i>Regin telleth Sigurd of his kindred, and of the Gold that was accursed from ancient days.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now yet the days pass over, and more than words may tell</span>
<span class="i0">Grows Sigurd strong and lovely, and all children love him well.</span>
<span class="i0">But oft he looks on the mountains and many a time is fain</span>
<span class="i0">To know of what lies beyond them, and learn of the wide world's gain.</span>
<span class="i0">And he saith: "I dwell in a land that is ruled by none of my blood;</span>
<span class="i0">And my mother's sons are waxing, and fair kings shall they be and good;</span>
<span class="i0">And their servant or their betrayer&mdash;not one of these will I be.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet needs must I wait for a little till Odin calls for me."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Now again it happed on a day that he sat in Regin's hall</span>
<span class="i0">And hearkened many tidings of what had chanced to fall,</span>
<span class="i0">And of kings that sought their kingdoms o'er many a waste and wild,</span>
<span class="i0">And at last saith the crafty master:</span>
<span class="i8">"Thou art King Sigmund's child:</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou wait till these kings of the carles shall die in a little land,</span>
<span class="i0">Or wilt thou serve their sons and carry the cup to their hand;</span>
<span class="i0">Or abide in vain for the day that never shall come about,</span>
<span class="i0">When their banners shall dance in the wind and shake to the war-gods' shout?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd answered and said: "Nought such do I look to be.</span>
<span class="i0">But thou, a deedless man, too much thou eggest me:</span>
<span class="i0">And these folk are good and trusty, and the land is lovely and sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">And in rest and in peace it lieth as the floor of Odin's feet:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I know that the world is wide, and filled with deeds unwrought;</span>
<span class="i0">And for e'en such work was I fashioned, lest the song-craft come to nought,</span>
<span class="i0">When the harps of God-home tinkle, and the Gods are at stretch to hearken;</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the hosts of the Gods be scanty when their day hath begun to darken,</span>
<span class="i0">When the bonds of the Wolf wax thin, and Loki fretteth his chain.</span>
<span class="i0">And sure for the house of my fathers full oft my heart is fain,</span>
<span class="i0">And meseemeth I hear them talking of the day when I shall come,</span>
<span class="i0">And of all the burden of deeds, that my hand shall bear them home.</span>
<span class="i0">And so when the deed is ready, nowise the man shall lack:</span>
<span class="i0">But the wary foot is the surest, and the hasty oft turns back."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then answered Regin the guileful: "The deed is ready to hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet holding my peace is the best, for well thou lovest the land;</span>
<span class="i0">And thou lovest thy life moreover, and the peace of thy youthful days,</span>
<span class="i0">And why should the full-fed feaster his hand to the rye-bread raise?</span>
<span class="i0">Yet they say that Sigmund begat thee and he looked to fashion a man.</span>
<span class="i0">Fear nought; he lieth quiet in his mound by the sea-waves wan."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So shone the eyes of Sigurd, that the shield against him hung</span>
<span class="i0">Cast back their light as the sunbeams; but his voice to the roof-tree rung:</span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me, thou Master of Masters, what deed is the deed I shall do?</span>
<span class="i0">Nor mock thou the son of Sigmund lest the day of his birth thou rue."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then answered the Master of Sleight: "The deed is the righting of wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">And the quelling a bale and a sorrow that the world hath endured o'erlong,</span>
<span class="i0">And the winning a treasure untold, that shall make thee more than the kings;</span>
<span class="i0">Thereof is the Helm of Aweing, the wonder of earthly things,</span>
<span class="i0">And thereof is its very fellow, the War-coat all of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">That has not its like in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then answered Sigurd the Volsung: "How long hereof hast thou known?</span>
<span class="i0">And what unto thee is this treasure, that thou seemest to give as thine own?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Alas!" quoth the smithying master, "it is mine, yet none of mine</span>
<span class="i0">Since my heart herein avails not, and my hand is frail and fine&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">It is long since I first came hither to seek a man for my need;</span>
<span class="i0">For I saw by a glimmering light that hence would spring the deed,</span>
<span class="i0">And many a deed of the world: but the generations passed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the first of the days was as near to the end that I sought as the last;</span>
<span class="i0">Till I looked on thine eyes in the cradle: and now I deem through thee,</span>
<span class="i0">That the end of my days of waiting, and the end of my woes shall be."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd awhile was silent; but at last he answered and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"Thou shalt have thy will and the treasure, and shalt take the curse on thine head</span>
<span class="i0">If a curse the gold enwrappeth: but the deed will I surely do,</span>
<span class="i0">For to-day the dreams of my childhood have bloomed in my heart anew:</span>
<span class="i0">And I long to look on the world and the glory of the earth</span>
<span class="i0">And to deal in the dealings of men, and garner the harvest of worth.</span>
<span class="i0">But tell me, thou Master of Masters, where lieth this measureless wealth;</span>
<span class="i0">Is it guarded by swords of the earl-folk, or kept by cunning and stealth?</span>
<span class="i0">Is it over the main sea's darkness, or beyond the mountain wall?</span>
<span class="i0">Or e'en in these peaceful acres anigh to the hands of all?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin answered sweetly: "Hereof must a tale be told:</span>
<span class="i0">Bide sitting, thou son of Sigmund, on the heap of unwrought gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And hearken of wondrous matters, and of things unheard, unsaid,</span>
<span class="i0">And deeds of my beholding ere the first of Kings was made.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And first ye shall know of a sooth, that I never was born of the race</span>
<span class="i0">Which the masters of God-home have made to cover the fair earth's face;</span>
<span class="i0">But I come of the Dwarfs departed; and fair was the earth whileome</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the short-lived thralls of the Gods amidst its dales were come:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And how were we worse than the Gods, though maybe we lived not as long?</span>
<span class="i0">Yet no weight of memory maimed us; nor aught we knew of wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">What felt our souls of shaming, what knew our hearts of love?</span>
<span class="i0">We did and undid at pleasure, and repented nought thereof.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Yea we were exceeding mighty&mdash;bear with me yet, my son;</span>
<span class="i0">For whiles can I scarcely think it that our days are wholly done.</span>
<span class="i0">And trust not thy life in my hands in the day when most I seem</span>
<span class="i0">Like the Dwarfs that are long departed, and most of my kindred I dream.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"So as we dwelt came tidings that the Gods amongst us were,</span>
<span class="i0">And the people come from Asgard: then rose up hope and fear,</span>
<span class="i0">And strange shapes of things went flitting betwixt the night and the eve,</span>
<span class="i0">And our sons waxed wild and wrathful, and our daughters learned to grieve.</span>
<span class="i0">Then we fell to the working of metal, and the deeps of the earth would know,</span>
<span class="i0">And we dealt with venom and leechcraft, and we fashioned spear and bow,</span>
<span class="i0">And we set the ribs to the oak-keel, and looked on the landless sea;</span>
<span class="i0">And the world began to be such-like as the Gods would have it to be.</span>
<span class="i0">In the womb of the woeful Earth had they quickened the grief and the gold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"It was Reidmar the Ancient begat me; and now was he waxen old,</span>
<span class="i0">And a covetous man and a king; and he bade, and I built him a hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And a golden glorious house; and thereto his sons did he call,</span>
<span class="i0">And he bade them be evil and wise, that his will through them might be wrought.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he gave unto Fafnir my brother the soul that feareth nought,</span>
<span class="i0">And the brow of the hardened iron, and the hand that may never fail,</span>
<span class="i0">And the greedy heart of a king, and the ear that hears no wail.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"But next unto Otter my brother he gave the snare and the net</span>
<span class="i0">And the longing to wend through the wild-wood, and wade the highways wet:</span>
<span class="i0">And the foot that never resteth, while aught be left alive</span>
<span class="i0">That hath cunning to match man's cunning or might with his might to strive.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And to me, the least and the youngest, what gift for the slaying of ease?</span>
<span class="i0">Save the grief that remembers the past, and the fear that the future sees;</span>
<span class="i0">And the hammer and fashioning-iron, and the living coal of fire;</span>
<span class="i0">And the craft that createth a semblance, and fails of the heart's desire;</span>
<span class="i0">And the toil that each dawning quickens and the task that is never done,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heart that longeth ever, nor will look to the deed that is won.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thus gave my father the gifts that might never be taken again;</span>
<span class="i0">Far worse were we now than the Gods, and but little better than men.</span>
<span class="i0">But yet of our ancient might one thing had we left us still:</span>
<span class="i0">We had craft to change our semblance, and could shift us at our will</span>
<span class="i0">Into bodies of the beast-kind, or fowl, or fishes cold;</span>
<span class="i0">For belike no fixed semblance we had in the days of old,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the Gods were waxen busy, and all things their form must take</span>
<span class="i0">That knew of good and evil, and longed to gather and make.</span>

<span class="i0">"So dwelt we, brethren and father; and Fafnir my brother fared</span>

<span class="i0">And the sun and the winds of heaven, and the fowl and the grass of the field</span>
<span class="i0">Were grown as the tools of my smithy; and all the world I knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And the glories that lie beyond it, and whitherward all things drew;</span>
<span class="i0">And myself a little fragment amidst it all I saw,</span>
<span class="i0">Grim, cold-heart, and unmighty as the tempest-driven straw.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Let be.&mdash;For Otter my brother saw seldom field or fold,</span>
<span class="i0">And he oftenest used that custom, whereof e'en now I told,</span>
<span class="i0">And would shift his shape with the wood-beasts and the things of land and sea;</span>
<span class="i0">And he knew what joy their hearts had, and what they longed to be,</span>
<span class="i0">And their dim-eyed understanding, and his wood-craft waxed so great,</span>
<span class="i0">That he seemed the king of the creatures and their very mortal fate.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Now as the years won over three folk of the heavenly halls</span>
<span class="i0">Grew aweary of sleepless sloth, and the day that nought befalls;</span>
<span class="i0">And they fain would look on the earth, and their latest handiwork,</span>
<span class="i0">And turn the fine gold over, lest a flaw therein should lurk.</span>
<span class="i0">And the three were the heart-wise Odin, the Father of the Slain,</span>
<span class="i0">And Loki, the World's Begrudger, who maketh all labour vain,</span>
<span class="i0">And H&aelig;nir, the Utter-Blameless, who wrought the hope of man,</span>
<span class="i0">And his heart and inmost yearnings, when first the work began;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;The God that was aforetime, and hereafter yet shall be</span>
<span class="i0">When the new light yet undreamed of shall shine o'er earth and sea.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thus about the world they wended and deemed it fair and good,</span>
<span class="i0">And they loved their life-days dearly: so came they to the wood,</span>
<span class="i0">And the lea without a shepherd and the dwellings of the deer,</span>
<span class="i0">And unto a mighty water that ran from a fathomless mere.</span>
<span class="i0">Now that flood my brother Otter had haunted many a day</span>
<span class="i0">For its plenteous fruit of fishes; and there on the bank he lay</span>
<span class="i0">As the Gods came wandering thither; and he slept, and in his dreams</span>
<span class="i0">He saw the downlong river, and its fishy-peopled streams,</span>
<span class="i0">And the swift smooth heads of its forces, and its swirling wells and deep,</span>
<span class="i0">Where hang the pois&egrave;d fishes, and their watch in the rock-halls keep.</span>
<span class="i0">And so, as he thought of it all, and its deeds and its wanderings,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereby it ran to the sea down the road of scaly things,</span>
<span class="i0">His body was changed with his thought, as yet was the wont of our kind,</span>
<span class="i0">And he grew but an Otter indeed; and his eyes were sleeping and blind</span>
<span class="i0">The while he devoured the prey, a golden red-flecked trout.</span>
<span class="i0">Then passed by Odin and H&aelig;nir, nor cumbered their souls with doubt;</span>
<span class="i0">But Loki lingered a little, and guile in his heart arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And he saw through the shape of the Otter, and beheld a chief of his foes,</span>
<span class="i0">A king of the free and the careless: so he called up his baleful might,</span>
<span class="i0">And gathered his godhead together, and tore a shard outright</span>
<span class="i0">From the rock-wall of the river, and across its green wells cast;</span>
<span class="i0">And roaring over the waters that bolt of evil passed,</span>
<span class="i0">And smote my brother Otter that his heart's life fled away,</span>
<span class="i0">And bore his man's shape with it, and beast-like there he lay,</span>
<span class="i0">Stark dead on the sun-lit blossoms: but the Evil God rejoiced,</span>
<span class="i0">And because of the sound of his singing the wild grew many-voiced.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then the three Gods waded the river, and no word H&aelig;nir spake,</span>
<span class="i0">For his thoughts were set on God-home, and the day that is ever awake.</span>
<span class="i0">But Odin laughed in his wrath, and murmured: 'Ah, how long,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the iron shall ring on the anvil for the shackles of thy wrong!'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Loki takes up the quarry, and is e'en as a man again;</span>
<span class="i0">And the three wend on through the wild-wood till they come to a grassy plain</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the untrodden mountains; and lo! a noble house,</span>
<span class="i0">And a hall with great craft fashioned, and made full glorious;</span>
<span class="i0">But night on the earth was falling; so scantly might they see</span>
<span class="i0">The wealth of its smooth-wrought stonework and its world of imagery:</span>
<span class="i0">Then Loki bade turn thither since day was at an end,</span>
<span class="i0">And into that noble dwelling the lords of God-home wend;</span>
<span class="i0">And the porch was fair and mighty, and so smooth-wrought was its gold,</span>
<span class="i0">That the mirrored stars of heaven therein might ye behold:</span>
<span class="i0">But the hall, what words shall tell it, how fair it rose aloft,</span>
<span class="i0">And the marvels of its windows, and its golden hangings soft,</span>
<span class="i0">And the forest of its pillars! and each like the wave's heart shone</span>
<span class="i0">And the mirrored boughs of the garden were dancing fair thereon.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Long years agone was it builded, and where are its wonders now?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Now the men of God-home marvelled, and gazed through the golden glow,</span>
<span class="i0">And a man like a covetous king amidst of the hall they saw;</span>
<span class="i0">And his chair was the tooth of the whale, wrought smooth with never a flaw;</span>
<span class="i0">And his gown was the sea-born purple, and he bore a crown on his head,</span>
<span class="i0">But never a sword was before him: kind-seeming words he said,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade rest to the weary feet that had worn the wild so long.</span>
<span class="i0">So they sat, and were men by seeming; and there rose up music and song,</span>
<span class="i0">And they ate and drank and were merry: but amidst the glee of the cup</span>
<span class="i0">They felt themselves tangled and caught, as when the net cometh up</span>
<span class="i0">Before the folk of the 'firth, and the main sea lieth far off;</span>
<span class="i0">And the laughter of lips they hearkened, and that hall-abider's scoff,</span>
<span class="i0">As his face and his mocking eyes anigh to their faces drew,</span>
<span class="i0">And their godhead was caught in the net, and no shift of creation they knew</span>
<span class="i0">To escape from their man-like bodies; so great that day was the Earth.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then spake the hall-abider: 'Where then is thy guileful mirth,</span>
<span class="i0">And thy hall-glee gone, O Loki? Come, H&aelig;nir, fashion now</span>
<span class="i0">My heart for love and for hope, that the fear in my body may grow,</span>
<span class="i0">That I may grieve and be sorry, that the ruth may arise in me,</span>
<span class="i0">As thou dealtst with the first of men-folk, when a master-smith thou wouldst be.</span>
<span class="i0">And thou, Allfather Odin, hast thou come on a bastard brood?</span>
<span class="i0">Or hadst thou belike a brother, thy twin for evil and good,</span>
<span class="i0">That waked amidst thy slumber, and slumbered midst thy work?</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, Wise-one, art thou silent as a child amidst the mirk?</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, I know ye are called the Gods, and are mighty men at home,</span>
<span class="i0">But now with a guilt on your heads to no feeble folk are ye come,</span>
<span class="i0">To a folk that need you nothing: time was when we knew you not:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet e'en then fresh was the winter, and the summer sun was hot,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wood-meats stayed our hunger, and the water quenched our thirst,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the good and the evil wedded and begat the best and the worst.</span>
<span class="i0">And how if to-day I undo it, that work of your fashioning,</span>
<span class="i0">If the web of the world run backward, and the high heavens lack a King?</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Woe's me! for your ancient mastery shall help you at your need:</span>
<span class="i0">If ye fill up the gulf of my longing and my empty heart of greed,</span>
<span class="i0">And slake the flame ye have quickened, then may ye go your ways</span>
<span class="i0">And get ye back to your kingship and the driving on of the days</span>
<span class="i0">To the day of the gathered war-hosts, and the tide of your Fateful Gloom.</span>
<span class="i0">Now nought may ye gainsay it that my mouth must speak the doom,</span>
<span class="i0">For ye wot well I am Reidmar, and that there ye lie red-hand</span>
<span class="i0">From the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;</span>
<span class="i0">For his death of my wold hath bereft me and every highway wet.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Nay, Loki, naught avails it, well-fashioned is the net.</span>
<span class="i0">Come forth, my son, my war-god, and show the Gods their work,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou who mightst learn e'en Loki, if need were to lie or lurk!'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And there was I, I Regin, the smithier of the snare,</span>
<span class="i0">And high up Fafnir towered with the brow that knew no fear,</span>
<span class="i0">With the wrathful and pitiless heart that was born of my father's will,</span>
<span class="i0">And the greed that the Gods had fashioned the fate of the earth to fulfill.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then spake the Father of Men: 'We have wrought thee wrong indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">And, wouldst thou amend it with wrong, thine errand must we speed;</span>
<span class="i0">For I know of thine heart's desire, and the gold thou shalt nowise lack,</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Nor all the works of the gold. But best were thy word drawn back,</span>
<span class="i0">If indeed the doom of the Norns be not utterly now gone forth.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Reidmar laughed and answered: 'So much is thy word of worth!</span>
<span class="i0">And they call thee Odin for this, and stretch forth hands in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">And pray for the gifts of a God who giveth and taketh again!</span>
<span class="i0">It was better in times past over, when we prayed for nought at all,</span>
<span class="i0">When no love taught us beseeching, and we had no troth to recall.</span>
<span class="i0">Ye have changed the world, and it bindeth with the right and the wrong ye have made,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor may ye be Gods henceforward save the rightful ransom be paid.</span>
<span class="i0">But perchance ye are weary of kingship, and will deal no more with the earth?</span>
<span class="i0">Then curse the world, and depart, and sit in your changeless mirth;</span>
<span class="i0">And there shall be no more kings, and battle and murder shall fail,</span>
<span class="i0">And the world shall laugh and long not, nor weep, nor fashion the tale.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"So spake Reidmar the Wise; but the wrath burned through his word,</span>
<span class="i0">And wasted his heart of wisdom; and there was Fafnir the Lord,</span>
<span class="i0">And there was Regin the Wright, and they raged at their father's back:</span>
<span class="i0">And all these cried out together with the voice of the sea-storm's wrack;</span>
<span class="i0">'O hearken, Gods of the Goths! ye shall die, and we shall be Gods,</span>
<span class="i0">And rule your men belov&egrave;d with bitter-heavy rods,</span>
<span class="i0">And make them beasts beneath us, save to-day ye do our will,</span>
<span class="i0">And pay us the ransom of blood, and our hearts with the gold fulfill.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"But Odin spake in answer, and his voice was awful and cold:</span>
<span class="i0">'Give righteous doom, O Reidmar! say what ye will of the Gold!'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Reidmar laughed in his heart, and his wrath and his wisdom fled,</span>
<span class="i0">And nought but his greed abided; and he spake from his throne and said:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Now hearken the doom I shall speak! Ye stranger-folk shall be free</span>
<span class="i0">When ye give me the Flame of the Waters, the gathered Gold of the Sea,</span>
<span class="i0">That Andvari hideth rejoicing in the wan realm pale as the grave;</span>
<span class="i0">And the Master of Sleight shall fetch it, and the hand that never gave,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heart that begrudgeth for ever shall gather and give and rue.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Lo! this is the doom of the wise, and no doom shall be spoken anew.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Odin spake: 'It is well; the Curser shall seek for the curse;</span>
<span class="i0">And the Greedy shall cherish the evil&mdash;and the seed of the Great they shall nurse.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"No word spake Reidmar the great, for the eyes of his heart were turned</span>
<span class="i0">To the edge of the outer desert, so sore for the gold he yearned.</span>
<span class="i0">But Loki I loosed from the toils, and he goeth his ways abroad;</span>
<span class="i0">And the heart of Odin he knoweth, and where he shall seek the Hoard.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"There is a desert of dread in the uttermost part of the world,</span>
<span class="i0">Where over a wall of mountains is a mighty water hurled,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose hidden head none knoweth, nor where it meeteth the sea;</span>
<span class="i0">And that force is the Force of Andvari, and an Elf of the Dark is he.</span>
<span class="i0">In the cloud and the desert he dwelleth amid that land alone;</span>
<span class="i0">And his work is the storing of treasure within his house of stone.</span>
<span class="i0">Time was when he knew of wisdom, and had many a tale to tell</span>
<span class="i0">Of the days before the Dwarf-age, and of what in that world befell:</span>
<span class="i0">And he knew of the stars and the sun, and the worlds that come and go</span>
<span class="i0">On the nether rim of heaven, and whence the wind doth blow,</span>
<span class="i0">And how the sea hangs balanced betwixt the curving lands,</span>
<span class="i0">And how all drew together for the first Gods' fashioning hands.</span>
<span class="i0">But now is all gone from him, save the craft of gathering gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And he heedeth nought of the summer, nor knoweth the winter cold,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor looks to the sun nor the snowfall, nor ever dreams of the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor hath heard of the making of men-folk, nor of where the high Gods be:</span>
<span class="i0">But ever he gripeth and gathereth, and he toileth hour by hour</span>
<span class="i0">Nor knoweth the noon from the midnight as he looks on his stony bower,</span>
<span class="i0">And saith: 'It is short, it is narrow for all I shall gather and get;</span>
<span class="i0">For the world is but newly fashioned, and long shall its years be yet.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"There Loki fareth, and seeth in a land of nothing good,</span>
<span class="i0">Far off o'er the empty desert, the reek of the falling flood</span>
<span class="i0">Go up to the floor of heaven, and thither turn his feet</span>
<span class="i0">As he weaveth the unseen meshes and the snare of strong deceit;</span>
<span class="i0">So he cometh his ways to the water, where the glittering foam-bow glows,</span>
<span class="i0">And the huge flood leaps the rock-wall and a green arch over it throws.</span>
<span class="i0">There under the roof of water he treads the quivering floor,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hush of the desert is felt amid the water's roar,</span>
<span class="i0">And the bleak sun lighteth the wave-vault, and tells of the fruitless plain,</span>
<span class="i0">And the showers that nourish nothing, and the summer come in vain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"There did the great Guile-master his toils and his tangles set,</span>
<span class="i0">And as wide as was the water, so wide was woven the net;</span>
<span class="i0">And as dim as the Elf's remembrance did the meshes of it show;</span>
<span class="i0">And he had no thought of sorrow, nor spared to come and go</span>
<span class="i0">On his errands of griping and getting till he felt himself tangled and caught:</span>
<span class="i0">Then back to his blinded soul was his ancient wisdom brought,</span>
<span class="i0">And he saw his fall and his ruin, as a man by the lightning's flame</span>
<span class="i0">Sees the garth all flooded by foemen; and again he remembered his name;</span>
<span class="i0">And e'en as a book well written the tale of the Gods he knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And the tale of the making of men, and much of the deeds they should do.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"But Loki took his man-shape, and laughed aloud and cried:</span>
<span class="i0">'What fish of the ends of the earth is so strong and so feeble-eyed,</span>
<span class="i0">That he draweth the pouch of my net on his road to the dwelling of Hell?</span>
<span class="i0">What Elf that hath heard the gold growing, but hath heard not the light winds tell</span>
<span class="i0">That the Gods with the world have been dealing and have fashioned men for the earth?</span>
<span class="i0">Where is he that hath ridden the cloud-horse and measured the ocean's girth,</span>
<span class="i0">But seen nought of the building of God-home nor the forging of the sword:</span>
<span class="i0">Where then is the maker of nothing, the earless and eyeless lord?</span>
<span class="i0">In the pouch of my net he lieth, with his head on the threshold of Hell!'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then the Elf lamented, and said: 'Thou knowst of my name full well:</span>
<span class="i0">Andvari begotten of Oinn, whom the Dwarf-kind called the Wise,</span>
<span class="i0">By the worst of the Gods is taken, the forge and the father of lies.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Said Loki: 'How of the Elf-kind, do they love their latter life,</span>
<span class="i0">When their weal is all departed, and they lie alow in the strife?'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Andvari groaned and answered: 'I know what thou wouldst have,</span>
<span class="i0">The wealth mine own hands gathered, the gold that no man gave.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'Come forth,' said Loki, 'and give it, and dwell in peace henceforth&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Or die in the toils if thou listest, if thy life be nothing worth.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Full sore the Elf lamented, but he came before the God</span>
<span class="i0">And the twain went into the rock-house and on fine gold they trod,</span>
<span class="i0">And the walls shone bright, and brighter than the sun of the upper air.</span>
<span class="i0">How great was that treasure of treasures: and the Helm of Dread was there;</span>
<span class="i0">The world but in dreams had seen it; and there was the hauberk of gold;</span>
<span class="i0">None other is in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Loki bade the Elf-king bring all to the upper day,</span>
<span class="i0">And he dight himself with his Godhead to bear the treasure away:</span>
<span class="i0">So there in the dim grey desert, before the God of Guile,</span>
<span class="i0">Great heaps of the hid-world's treasure the weary Elf must pile,</span>
<span class="i0">And Loki looked on laughing: but, when it all was done,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Elf was hurrying homeward, his finger gleamed in the sun:</span>
<span class="i0">Then Loki cried: 'Thou art guileful: thou hast not learned the tale</span>
<span class="i0">Of the wisdom that Gods have gotten and their might of all avail.</span>
<span class="i0">Hither to me! that I learn thee of a many things to come;</span>
<span class="i0">Or despite of all wilt thou journey to the dead man's deedless home.</span>
<span class="i0">Come hither again to thy master, and give the ring to me;</span>
<span class="i0">For meseems it is Loki's portion, and the Bale of Men shall it be.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then the Elf drew off the gold-ring and stood with empty hand</span>
<span class="i0">E'en where the flood fell over 'twixt the water and the land,</span>
<span class="i0">And he gazed on the great Guile-master, and huge and grim he grew;</span>
<span class="i0">And his anguish swelled within him, and the word of the Norns he knew;</span>
<span class="i0">How that gold was the seed of gold to the wise and the shapers of things,</span>
<span class="i0">The hoarders of hidden treasure, and the unseen glory of rings;</span>
<span class="i0">But the seed of woe to the world and the foolish wasters of men,</span>
<span class="i0">And grief to the generations that die and spring again:</span>
<span class="i0">Then he cried:</span>
<span class="i8">'There farest thou, Loki, and might I load thee worse</span>
<span class="i0">Than with what thine ill heart beareth, then shouldst thou bear my curse:</span>
<span class="i0">But for men a curse thou bearest: entangled in my gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Amid my woe abideth another woe untold.</span>
<span class="i0">Two brethren and a father, eight kings my grief shall slay;</span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of queens shall be broken, and their eyes shall loathe the day.</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how the wilderness blossoms! Lo, how the lonely lands</span>
<span class="i0">Are waving with the harvest that fell from my gathering hands!'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"But Loki laughed in silence, and swift in Godhead went,</span>
<span class="i0">To the golden hall of Reidmar and the house of our content.</span>
<span class="i0">But when that world of treasure was laid within our hall</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas as if the sun were minded to live 'twixt wall and wall,</span>
<span class="i0">And all we stood by and panted. Then Odin spake and said:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'O Kings, O folk of the Dwarf-kind, lo, the ransom duly paid!</span>
<span class="i0">Will ye have this sun of the ocean, and reap the fruitful field,</span>
<span class="i0">And garner up the harvest that earth therefrom shall yield?'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"So he spake; but a little season nought answered Reidmar the wise</span>
<span class="i0">But turned his face from the Treasure, and peered with eager eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Endlong the hall and athwart it, as a man may chase about</span>
<span class="i0">A ray of the sun of the morning that a naked sword throws out;</span>
<span class="i0">And lo! from Loki's right-hand came the flash of the fruitful ring,</span>
<span class="i0">And at last spake Reidmar scowling:</span>
<span class="i8">'Ye wait for my yea-saying</span>
<span class="i0">That your feet may go free on the earth, and the fear of my toils may be done;</span>
<span class="i0">That then ye may say in your laughter: The fools of the time agone!</span>
<span class="i0">The purblind eyes of the Dwarf-kind! they have gotten the garnered sheaf</span>
<span class="i0">And have let their Masters depart with the Seed of Gold and of Grief:</span>
<span class="i0">O Loki, friend of Allfather, cast down Andvari's Ring,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the world shall yet turn backward and the high heavens lack a king.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then Loki drew off the Elf-ring and cast it down on the heap,</span>
<span class="i0">And forth as the gold met gold did the light of its glory leap:</span>
<span class="i0">But he spake: 'It rejoiceth my heart that no whit of all ye shall lack,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the curse of the Elf-king cleave not, and ye 'scape the utter wrack.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then laughed and answered Reidmar: 'I shall have it while I live,</span>
<span class="i0">And that shall be long, meseemeth: for who is there may strive</span>
<span class="i0">With my sword, the war-wise Fafnir, and my shield that is Regin the Smith?</span>
<span class="i0">But if indeed I should die, then let men-folk deal therewith,</span>
<span class="i0">And ride to the golden glitter through evil deeds and good.</span>
<span class="i0">I will have my heart's desire, and do as the high Gods would.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then I loosed the Gods from their shackles, and great they grew on the floor</span>
<span class="i0">And into the night they gat them; but Odin turned by the door,</span>
<span class="i0">And we looked not, little we heeded, for we grudged his mastery;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake, and his voice was waxen as the voice of the winter sea:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'O Kings, O folk of the Dwarfs, why then will ye covet and rue?</span>
<span class="i0">I have seen your fathers' fathers and the dust wherefrom they grew;</span>
<span class="i0">But who hath heard of my father or the land where first I sprung?</span>
<span class="i0">Who knoweth my day of repentance, or the year when I was young?</span>
<span class="i0">Who hath learned the names of the Wise-one or measured out his will?</span>
<span class="i0">Who hath gone before to teach him, and the doom of days fulfill?</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, I look on the Curse of the Gold, and wrong amended by wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">And love by love confounded, and the strong abased by the strong;</span>
<span class="i0">And I order it all and amend it, and the deeds that are done I see,</span>
<span class="i0">And none other beholdeth or knoweth; and who shall be wise unto me?</span>
<span class="i0">For myself to myself I offered, that all wisdom I might know,</span>
<span class="i0">And fruitful I waxed of works, and good and fair did they grow;</span>
<span class="i0">And I knew, and I wrought and fore-ordered; and evil sat by my side,</span>
<span class="i0">And myself by myself hath been doomed, and I look for the fateful tide;</span>
<span class="i0">And I deal with the generations, and the men mine hand hath made,</span>
<span class="i0">And myself by myself shall be grieved, lest the world and its fashioning fade.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"They went and the Gold abided: but the words Allfather spake,</span>
<span class="i0">I call them back full often for that golden even's sake,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet little that hour I heard them, save as wind across the lea;</span>
<span class="i0">For the gold shone up on Reidmar and on Fafnir's face and on me.</span>
<span class="i0">And sore I loved that treasure: so I wrapped my heart in guile,</span>
<span class="i0">And sleeked my tongue with sweetness, and set my face in a smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And I bade my father keep it, the more part of the gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet give good store to Fafnir for his goodly help and bold,</span>
<span class="i0">And deal me a little handful for my smithying-help that day.</span>
<span class="i0">But no little I desired, though for little I might pray;</span>
<span class="i0">And prayed I for much or for little, he answered me no more</span>
<span class="i0">Than the shepherd answers the wood-wolf who howls at the yule-tide door:</span>
<span class="i0">But good he ever deemed it to sit on his ivory throne,</span>
<span class="i0">And stare on the red rings' glory, and deem he was ever alone:</span>
<span class="i0">And never a word spake Fafnir, but his eyes waxed red and grim</span>
<span class="i0">As he looked upon our father, and noted the ways of him.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"The night waned into the morning, and still above the Hoard</span>
<span class="i0">Sat Reidmar clad in purple; but Fafnir took his sword,</span>
<span class="i0">And I took my smithying-hammer, and apart in the world we went;</span>
<span class="i0">But I came aback in the even, and my heart was heavy and spent;</span>
<span class="i0">And I longed, but fear was upon me and I durst not go to the Gold;</span>
<span class="i0">So I lay in the house of my toil mid the things I had fashioned of old;</span>
<span class="i0">And methought as I lay in my bed 'twixt waking and slumber of night</span>
<span class="i0">That I heard the tinkling metal and beheld the hall alight,</span>
<span class="i0">But I slept and dreamed of the Gods, and the things that never have slept,</span>
<span class="i0">Till I woke to a cry and a clashing and forth from the bed I leapt,</span>
<span class="i0">And there by the heaped-up Elf-gold my brother Fafnir stood,</span>
<span class="i0">And there at his feet lay Reidmar and reddened the Treasure with blood;</span>
<span class="i0">And e'en as I looked on his eyen they glazed and whitened with death,</span>
<span class="i0">And forth on the torch-litten hall he shed his latest breath.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"But I looked on Fafnir and trembled for he wore the Helm of Dread,</span>
<span class="i0">And his sword was bare in his hand, and the sword and the hand were red</span>
<span class="i0">With the blood of our father Reidmar, and his body was wrapped in gold,</span>
<span class="i0">With the ruddy-gleaming mailcoat of whose fellow hath nought been told,</span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as I looked upon him that he grew beneath mine eyes:</span>
<span class="i0">And then in the mid-hall's silence did his dreadful voice arise:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"'I have slain my father Reidmar, that I alone might keep</span>
<span class="i0">The Gold of the darksome places, the Candle of the Deep.</span>
<span class="i0">I am such as the Gods have made me, lest the Dwarf-kind people the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">Or mingle their ancient wisdom with its short-lived latest birth.</span>
<span class="i0">I shall dwell alone henceforward, and the Gold and its waxing curse,</span>
<span class="i0">I shall brood on them both together, let my life grow better or worse.</span>
<span class="i0">And I am a King henceforward and long shall be my life,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Gold shall grow with my longing, for I shall hide it from strife,</span>
<span class="i0">And hoard up the Ring of Andvari in the house thine hand hath built.</span>
<span class="i0">O thou, wilt thou tarry and tarry, till I cast thy blood on the guilt?</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, I am a King for ever, and alone on the Gold shall I dwell</span>
<span class="i0">And do no deed to repent of and leave no tale to tell.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"More awful grew his visage as he spake the word of dread</span>
<span class="i0">And no more durst I behold him, but with heart a-cold I fled;</span>
<span class="i0">I fled from the glorious house my hands had made so fair,</span>
<span class="i0">As poor as the new-born baby with nought of raiment or gear:</span>
<span class="i0">I fled from the heaps of gold, and my goods were the eager will,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heart that remembereth all, and the hand that may never be still.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then unto this land I came, and that was long ago</span>
<span class="i0">As men-folk count the years; and I taught them to reap and to sow,</span>
<span class="i0">And a famous man I became: but that generation died,</span>
<span class="i0">And they said that Frey had taught them, and a God my name did hide.</span>
<span class="i0">Then I taught them the craft of metals, and the sailing of the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And the taming of the horse-kind, and the yoke-beasts' husbandry,</span>
<span class="i0">And the building up of houses; and that race of men went by,</span>
<span class="i0">And they said that Thor had taught them; and a smithying-carle was I.</span>
<span class="i0">Then I gave their maidens the needle and I bade them hold the rock,</span>
<span class="i0">And the shuttle-race gaped for them as they sat at the weaving-stock.</span>
<span class="i0">But by then these were waxen crones to sit dim-eyed by the door,</span>
<span class="i0">It was Freyia had come among them to teach the weaving-lore.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then I taught them the tales of old, and fair songs fashioned and true,</span>
<span class="i0">And their speech grew into music of measured time and due,</span>
<span class="i0">And they smote the harp to my bidding, and the land grew soft and sweet:</span>
<span class="i0">But ere the grass of their grave-mounds rose up above my feet,</span>
<span class="i0">It was Bragi had made them sweet-mouthed, and I was the wandering scald;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet green did my cunning flourish by whatso name I was called,</span>
<span class="i0">And I grew the master of masters&mdash;Think thou how strange it is</span>
<span class="i0">That the sword in the hands of a stripling shall one day end all this!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yet oft mid all my wisdom did I long for my brother's part,</span>
<span class="i0">And Fafnir's mighty kingship weighed heavy on my heart</span>
<span class="i0">When the Kings of the earthly kingdoms would give me golden gifts</span>
<span class="i0">From out of their scanty treasures, due pay for my cunning shifts.</span>
<span class="i0">And once&mdash;didst thou number the years thou wouldst think it long ago&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I wandered away to the country from whence our stem did grow.</span>
<span class="i0">There methought the fells grown greater, but waste did the meadows lie</span>
<span class="i0">And the house was rent and ragged and open to the sky.</span>
<span class="i0">But lo, when I came to the doorway, great silence brooded there,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor bat nor owl would haunt it, nor the wood-wolves drew anear.</span>
<span class="i0">Then I went to the pillared hall-stead, and lo, huge heaps of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And to and fro amidst them a mighty Serpent rolled:</span>
<span class="i0">Then my heart grew chill with terror, for I thought on the wont of our race,</span>
<span class="i0">And I, who had lost their cunning, was a man in a deadly place,</span>
<span class="i0">A feeble man and a swordless in the lone destroyer's fold;</span>
<span class="i0">For I knew that the Worm was Fafnir, the Wallower on the Gold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"So I gathered my strength and fled, and hid my shame again</span>
<span class="i0">Mid the foolish sons of men-folk; and the more my hope was vain,</span>
<span class="i0">The more I longed for the Treasure, and deliv'rance from the yoke:</span>
<span class="i0">And yet passed the generations, and I dwelt with the short-lived folk.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Long years, and long years after the tale of men-folk told</span>
<span class="i0">How up on the Glittering Heath was the house and the dwelling of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And within that house was the Serpent, and the Lord of the Fearful Face:</span>
<span class="i0">Then I wondered sore of the desert; for I thought of the golden place</span>
<span class="i0">My hands of old had builded; for I knew by many a sign</span>
<span class="i0">That the Fearful Face was my brother, that the blood</span>
<span class="i0">of the Worm was mine.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"This was ages long ago, and yet in that desert he dwells,</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt him and men death lieth, and no man of his semblance tells;</span>
<span class="i0">But the tale of the great Gold-wallower is never the more outworn.</span>
<span class="i0">Then came thy kin, O Sigurd, and thy father's father was born,</span>
<span class="i0">And I fell to the dreaming of dreams, and I saw thine eyes therein,</span>
<span class="i0">And I looked and beheld thy glory and all that thy sword should win;</span>
<span class="i0">And I thought that thou shouldst be he, who should bring my heart its rest,</span>
<span class="i0">That of all the gifts of the Kings thy sword should give me the best.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Ah, I fell to the dreaming of dreams; and oft the gold I saw,</span>
<span class="i0">And the golden-fashioned Hauberk, clean-wrought without a flaw,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Helm that aweth the world; and I knew of Fafnir's heart</span>
<span class="i0">That his wisdom was greater than mine, because he had held him apart,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor spilt on the sons of men-folk our knowledge of ancient days,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor bartered one whit for their love, nor craved for the people's praise.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"And some day I shall have it all, his gold and his craft and his heart</span>
<span class="i0">And the gathered and garnered wisdom he guards in the mountains apart.</span>
<span class="i0">And then when my hand is upon it, my hand shall be as the spring</span>
<span class="i0">To thaw his winter away and the fruitful tide to bring.</span>
<span class="i0">It shall grow, it shall grow into summer, and I shall be he that wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">And my deeds shall be remembered, and my name that once was nought;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea I shall be Frey, and Thor, and Freyia, and Bragi in one:</span>
<span class="i0">Yea the God of all that is,&mdash;and no deed in the wide world done,</span>
<span class="i0">But the deed that my heart would fashion: and the songs of the freed from the yoke</span>
<span class="i0">Shall bear to my house in the heavens the love and the longing of folk;</span>
<span class="i0">And there shall be no more dying, and the sea shall be as the land,</span>
<span class="i0">And the world for ever and ever shall be young beneath my hand."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then his eyelids fell, and he slumbered, and it seemed as Sigurd gazed</span>
<span class="i0">That the flames leapt up in the stithy and about the Master blazed,</span>
<span class="i0">And his hand in the harp-strings wandered and the sweetness from them poured.</span>
<span class="i0">Then unto his feet leapt Sigurd and drew his stripling's sword,</span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: "Awake, O Master, for, lo, the day goes by,</span>
<span class="i0">And this too is an ancient story, that the sons of men-folk die,</span>
<span class="i0">And all save fame departeth. Awake! for the day grows late,</span>
<span class="i0">And deeds by the door are passing, nor the Norns will have them wait."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin groaned and wakened, sad-eyed and heavy-browed,</span>
<span class="i0">And weary and worn was he waxen, as a man by a burden bowed:</span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Hast thou hearkened, Sigurd, wilt thou help a man that is old</span>
<span class="i0">To avenge him for his father? Wilt thou win that Treasure of Gold</span>
<span class="i0">And be more than the Kings of the earth? Wilt thou rid the earth of a wrong</span>
<span class="i0">And heal the woe and the sorrow my heart hath endured o'erlong?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked upon him with steadfast eyes and clear,</span>
<span class="i0">And Regin drooped and trembled as he stood the doom to hear:</span>
<span class="i0">But the bright child spake as aforetime, and answered the Master and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"Thou shalt have thy will, and the Treasure, and take the curse on thine head."</span>
</div></div>


<h4><i>Of the forging of the Sword that is called The Wrath of Sigurd.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now again came Sigurd to Regin, and said: "Thou hast taught me a task</span>
<span class="i0">Whereof none knoweth the ending: and a gift at thine hands I ask."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then answered Regin the Master: "The world must be wide indeed</span>
<span class="i0">If my hand may not reach across it for aught thine heart may need."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yea wide is the world," said Sigurd, "and soon spoken is thy word;</span>
<span class="i0">But this gift thou shalt nought gainsay me: for I bid thee forge me a sword."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the Master of Masters, and his voice was sweet and soft,</span>
<span class="i0">"Look forth abroad, O Sigurd, and note in the heavens aloft</span>
<span class="i0">How the dim white moon of the daylight hangs round as the Goth-God's shield:</span>
<span class="i0">Now for thee first rang mine anvil when she walked the heavenly field</span>
<span class="i0">A slim and lovely lady, and the old moon lay on her arm:</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, here is a sword I have wrought thee with many a spell and charm</span>
<span class="i0">And all the craft of the Dwarf-kind; be glad thereof and sure;</span>
<span class="i0">Mid many a storm of battle full well shall it endure."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked on the slayer, and never a word would speak:</span>
<span class="i0">Gemmed were the hilts and golden, and the blade was blue and bleak,</span>
<span class="i0">And runes of the Dwarf-kind's cunning each side the trench were scored:</span>
<span class="i0">But soft and sweet spake Regin: "How likest thou the sword?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd laughed and answered: "The work is proved by the deed;</span>
<span class="i0">See now if this be a traitor to fail me in my need."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin trembled and shrank, so bright his eyes outshone</span>
<span class="i0">As he turned about to the anvil, and smote the sword thereon;</span>
<span class="i0">But the shards fell shivering earthward, and Sigurd's heart grew wroth</span>
<span class="i0">As the steel-flakes tinkled about him: "Lo, there the right-hand's troth!</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, there the golden glitter, and the word that soon is spilt."</span>
<span class="i0">And down amongst the ashes he cast the glittering hilt,</span>
<span class="i0">And turned his back on Regin and strode out through the door</span>
<span class="i0">And for many a day of spring-tide came back again no more.</span>
<span class="i0">But at last he came to the stithy and again took up the word:</span>
<span class="i0">"What hast thou done, O Master, in the forging of the sword?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then sweetly Regin answered: "Hard task-master art thou,</span>
<span class="i0">But lo, a blade of battle that shall surely please thee now!</span>
<span class="i0">Two moons are clean departed since thou lookedst toward the sky</span>
<span class="i0">And sawest the dim white circle amid the cloud-flecks lie;</span>
<span class="i0">And night and day have I laboured; and the cunning of old days</span>
<span class="i0">Hath surely left my right-hand if this sword thou shalt not praise."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And indeed the hilts gleamed glorious with many a dear-bought stone,</span>
<span class="i0">And down the fallow edges the light of battle shone;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Sigurd's eyes shone brighter, nor yet might Regin face</span>
<span class="i0">Those eyes of the heart of the Volsungs; but trembled in his place</span>
<span class="i0">As Sigurd cried: "O Regin, thy kin of the days of old</span>
<span class="i0">Were an evil and treacherous folk, and they lied and murdered for gold;</span>
<span class="i0">And now if thou wouldst bewray me, of the ancient curse beware,</span>
<span class="i0">And set thy face as the flint the bale and the shame to bear:</span>
<span class="i0">For he that would win to the heavens, and be as the Gods on high</span>
<span class="i0">Must tremble nought at the road, and the place where men-folk die."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">White leaps the blade in his hand and gleams in the gear of the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">And he smites, and the oft-smitten edges on the beaten anvil fall:</span>
<span class="i0">But the life of the sword departed, and dull and broken it lay</span>
<span class="i0">On the ashes and flaked-off iron, and no word did Sigurd say,</span>
<span class="i0">But strode off through the door of the stithy and went to the Hall of Kings,</span>
<span class="i0">And was merry and blithe that even mid all imaginings.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But when the morrow was come he went to his mother and spake:</span>
<span class="i0">"The shards, the shards of the sword, that thou gleanedst for my sake</span>
<span class="i0">In the night on the field of slaughter, in the tide when my father fell,</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou kept them through sorrow and joyance? hast thou warded them trusty and well?</span>
<span class="i0">Where hast thou laid them, my mother?"</span>
<span class="i8">Then she looked upon him and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"Art thou wroth, O Sigurd my son, that such eyes are in thine head?</span>
<span class="i0">And wilt thou be wroth with thy mother? do I withstand thee at all?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Nay," said he, "nought am I wrathful, but the days rise up like a wall</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt my soul and the deeds, and I strive to rend them through.</span>
<span class="i0">And why wilt thou fear mine eyen? as the sword lies baleful and blue</span>
<span class="i0">E'en 'twixt the lips of lovers, when they swear their troth thereon,</span>
<span class="i0">So keen are the eyes ye have fashioned, ye folk of the days agone;</span>
<span class="i0">For therein is the light of battle, though whiles it lieth asleep.</span>
<span class="i0">Now give me the sword, my mother, that Sigmund gave thee to keep."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">She said: "I shall give it thee gladly, for fain shall I be of thy praise</span>
<span class="i0">When thou knowest my careful keeping of that hope of the earlier days."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So she took his hand in her hand, and they went their ways, they twain,</span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to the treasure of queen-folk, the guarded chamber of gain:</span>
<span class="i0">They were all alone with its riches, and she turned the key in the gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And lifted the sea-born purple, and the silken web unrolled,</span>
<span class="i0">And lo, 'twixt her hands and her bosom the shards of Sigmund's sword;</span>
<span class="i0">No rust-fleck stained its edges, and the gems of the ocean's hoard</span>
<span class="i0">Were as bright in the hilts and glorious, as when in the Volsungs' hall</span>
<span class="i0">It shone in the eyes of the earl-folk and flashed from the shielded wall.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Sigurd smiled upon it, and he said: "O Mother of Kings,</span>
<span class="i0">Well hast thou warded the war-glaive for a mirror of many things,</span>
<span class="i0">And a hope of much fulfilment: well hast thou given to me</span>
<span class="i0">The message of my fathers, and the word of things to be:</span>
<span class="i0">Trusty hath been thy warding, but its hour is over now:</span>
<span class="i0">These shards shall be knit together, and shall hear the war-wind blow.</span>
<span class="i0">They shall shine through the rain of Odin, as the sun come back to the world,</span>
<span class="i0">When the heaviest bolt of the thunder amidst the storm is hurled:</span>
<span class="i0">They shall shake the thrones of Kings, and shear the walls of war,</span>
<span class="i0">And undo the knot of treason when the world is darkening o'er.</span>
<span class="i0">They have shone in the dusk and the night-tide, they shall shine in the dawn and the day;</span>
<span class="i0">They have gathered the storm together, they shall chase the clouds away;</span>
<span class="i0">They have sheared red gold asunder, they shall gleam o'er the garnered gold;</span>
<span class="i0">They have ended many a story, they shall fashion a tale to be told:</span>
<span class="i0">They have lived in the wrack of the people; they shall live in the glory of folk:</span>
<span class="i0">They have stricken the Gods in battle, for the Gods shall they strike the stroke."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then she felt his hands about her as he took the fateful sword,</span>
<span class="i0">And he kissed her soft and sweetly; but she answered never a word:</span>
<span class="i0">So great and fair was he waxen, so glorious was his face,</span>
<span class="i0">So young, as the deathless Gods are, that long in the golden place</span>
<span class="i0">She stood when he was departed: as some for-travailed one</span>
<span class="i0">Comes over the dark fell-ridges on the birth-tide of the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And his gathering sleep falls from him mid the glory and the blaze;</span>
<span class="i0">And he sees the world grow merry and looks on the lightened ways,</span>
<span class="i0">While the ruddy streaks are melting in the day-flood broad and white;</span>
<span class="i0">Then the morn-dusk he forgetteth, and the moon-lit waste of night,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hall whence he departed with its yellow candles' flare:</span>
<span class="i0">So stood the Isle-king's daughter in that treasure-chamber fair.</span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But swift on his ways went Sigurd, and to Regin's house he came,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the Master stood in the doorway and behind him leapt the flame,</span>
<span class="i0">And dark he looked and little: no more his speech was sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">No words on his lip were gathered the Volsung child to greet,</span>
<span class="i0">Till he took the sword from Sigurd and the shards of the days of old;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake:</span>
<span class="i8">"Will nothing serve thee save this blue steel and cold,</span>
<span class="i0">The bane of thy father's father, the fate of all his kin,</span>
<span class="i0">The baleful blade I fashioned, the Wrath that the Gods would win?"</span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered the eye-bright Sigurd: "If thou thy craft wilt do</span>
<span class="i0">Nought save these battle-gleanings shall be my helper true:</span>
<span class="i0">And what if thou begrudgest, and my battle-blade be dull,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet the hand of the Norns is lifted and the cup is over-full.</span>
<span class="i0">Repentst thou ne'er so sorely that thy kin must lie alow,</span>
<span class="i0">How much soe'er thou longest the world to overthrow,</span>
<span class="i0">And, doubting the gold and the wisdom, wouldst even now appease</span>
<span class="i0">Blind hate and eyeless murder, and win the world with these;</span>
<span class="i0">O'er-late is the time for repenting the word thy lips have said:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt have the Gold and the wisdom and take its curse on thine head.</span>
<span class="i0">I say that thy lips have spoken, and no more with thee it lies</span>
<span class="i0">To do the deed or leave it: since thou hast shown mine eyes</span>
<span class="i0">The world that was aforetime, I see the world to be;</span>
<span class="i0">And woe to the tangling thicket, or the wall that hindereth me!</span>
<span class="i0">And short is the space I will tarry; for how if the Worm should die</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the first of my strokes be stricken? Wilt thou get to thy mastery</span>
<span class="i0">And knit these shards together that once in the Branstock stood?</span>
<span class="i0">But if not and a smith's hands fail me, a king's hand yet shall be good;</span>
<span class="i0">And the Norns have doomed thy brother. And yet I deem this sword</span>
<span class="i0">Is the slayer of the Serpent, and the scatterer of the Hoard."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Great waxed the gloom of Regin, and he said: "Thou sayest sooth</span>
<span class="i0">For none may turn him backward: the sword of a very youth</span>
<span class="i0">Shall one day end my cunning, as the Gods my joyance slew,</span>
<span class="i0">When nought thereof they were deeming, and another thing would do.</span>
<span class="i0">But this sword shall slay the Serpent; and do another deed,</span>
<span class="i0">And many an one thereafter till it fail thee in thy need.</span>
<span class="i0">But as fair and great as thou standest, yet get thee from mine house,</span>
<span class="i0">For in me too might ariseth, and the place is perilous</span>
<span class="i0">With the craft that was aforetime, and shall never be again,</span>
<span class="i0">When the hands that have taught thee cunning have failed from the world of men.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art wroth; but thy wrath must slumber till fate its blossom bear;</span>
<span class="i0">Not thus were the eyes of Odin when I held him in the snare.</span>
<span class="i0">Depart! lest the end overtake us ere thy work and mine be done,</span>
<span class="i0">But come again in the night-tide and the slumber of the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">When the sharded moon of April hangs round in the undark May."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Hither and thither a while did the heart of Sigurd sway</span>
<span class="i0">For he feared no craft of the Dwarf-kind, nor heeded the ways of Fate,</span>
<span class="i0">But his hand wrought e'en as his heart would: and now was he weary with hate</span>
<span class="i0">Of the hatred and scorn of the Gods, and the greed of gold and of gain,</span>
<span class="i0">And the weaponless hands of the stripling of the wrath and the rending were fain,</span>
<span class="i0">But there stood Regin the Master, and his eyes were on Sigurd's eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Though nought belike they beheld him, and his brow was sad and wise;</span>
<span class="i0">And the greed died out of his visage and he stood like an image of old.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So the Norns drew Sigurd away, and the tide was an even of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And sweet in the April even were the fowl-kind singing their best;</span>
<span class="i0">And the light of life smote Sigurd, and the joy that knows no rest,</span>
<span class="i0">And the fond unnamed desire, and the hope of hidden things;</span>
<span class="i0">And he wended fair and lovely to the house of the feasting Kings.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But now when the moon was at full and the undark May begun,</span>
<span class="i0">Went Sigurd unto Regin mid the slumber of the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And amidst the fire-hall's pavement the King of the Dwarf-kind stood</span>
<span class="i0">Like an image of deeds departed and days that once were good;</span>
<span class="i0">And he seemed but faint and weary, and his eyes were dim and dazed</span>
<span class="i0">As they met the glory of Sigurd where the fitful candles blazed.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake:</span>
<span class="i2">"Hail, Son of the Volsungs, the corner-stone is laid,</span>
<span class="i0">I have toiled and thou hast desired, and, lo, the fateful blade!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd saw it lying on the ashes slaked and pale</span>
<span class="i0">Like the sun and the lightning mingled mid the even's cloudy bale;</span>
<span class="i0">For ruddy and great were the hilts, and the edges fine and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">And all adown to the blood-point a very flame there ran</span>
<span class="i0">That swallowed the runes of wisdom wherewith its sides were scored.</span>
<span class="i0">No sound did Sigurd utter as he stooped adown for his sword,</span>
<span class="i0">But it seemed as his lips were moving with speech of strong desire.</span>
<span class="i0">White leapt the blade o'er his head, and he stood in the ring of its fire</span>
<span class="i0">As hither and thither it played, till it fell on the anvil's strength,</span>
<span class="i0">And he cried aloud in his glory, and held out the sword full length,</span>
<span class="i0">As one who would show it the world; for the edges were dulled no whit,</span>
<span class="i0">And the anvil was cleft to the pavement with the dreadful dint of it.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Regin cried to his harp-strings: "Before the days of men</span>
<span class="i0">I smithied the Wrath of Sigurd, and now is it smithied again:</span>
<span class="i0">And my hand alone hath done it, and my heart alone hath dared</span>
<span class="i0">To bid that man to the mountain, and behold his glory bared.</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, if the son of Sigmund might wot of the thing I would,</span>
<span class="i0">Then how were the ages bettered, and the world all waxen good!</span>
<span class="i0">Then how were the past forgotten and the weary days of yore,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hope of man that dieth and the waste that never bore!</span>
<span class="i0">How should this one live through the winter and know of all increase!</span>
<span class="i0">How should that one spring to the sunlight and bear the blossom of peace!</span>
<span class="i0">No more should the long-lived wisdom o'er the waste of the wilderness stray;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor the clear-eyed hero hasten to the deedless ending of day.</span>
<span class="i0">And what if the hearts of the Volsungs for this deed of deeds were born,</span>
<span class="i0">How then were their life-days evil and the end of their lives forlorn?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">There stood Sigurd the Volsung, and heard how the harp-strings rang,</span>
<span class="i0">But of other things they told him than the hope that the Master sang;</span>
<span class="i0">And his world lay far away from the Dwarf-king's eyeless realm</span>
<span class="i0">And the road that leadeth nowhere, and the ship without a helm:</span>
<span class="i0">But he spake: "How oft shall I say it, that I shall work thy will?</span>
<span class="i0">If my father hath made me mighty, thine heart shall I fulfill</span>
<span class="i0">With the wisdom and gold thou wouldest, before I wend on my ways;</span>
<span class="i0">For now hast thou failed me nought, and the sword is the wonder of days."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">No word for a while spake Regin; but he hung his head adown</span>
<span class="i0">As a man that pondereth sorely, and his voice once more was grown</span>
<span class="i0">As the voice of the smithying-master as he spake: "This Wrath of thine</span>
<span class="i0">Hath cleft the hard and the heavy; it shall shear the soft and the fine:</span>
<span class="i0">Come forth to the night and prove it."</span>
<span class="i8">So they twain went forth abroad,</span>
<span class="i0">And the moon lay white on the river and lit the sleepless ford,</span>
<span class="i0">And down to its pools they wended, and the stream was swift and full;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Regin cast against it a lock of fine-spun wool,</span>
<span class="i0">And it whirled about on the eddy till it met the edges bared,</span>
<span class="i0">And as clean as the careless water the laboured fleece was sheared.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin spake: "It is good, what the smithying-carle hath wrought:</span>
<span class="i0">Now the work of the King beginneth, and the end that my soul hath sought.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt toil and I shall desire, and the deed shall be surely done:</span>
<span class="i0">For thy Wrath is alive and awake and the story of bale is begun."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Therewith was the Wrath of Sigurd laid soft in a golden sheath</span>
<span class="i0">And the peace-strings knit around it; for that blade was fain of death;</span>
<span class="i0">And 'tis ill to show such edges to the broad blue light of day,</span>
<span class="i0">Or to let the hall-glare light them, if ye list not play the play.</span>
</div></div>

<h4><i>Of Gripir's Foretelling.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sigurd backeth Greyfell on the first of the morrow morn,</span>
<span class="i0">And he rideth fair and softly through the acres of the corn;</span>
<span class="i0">The Wrath to his side is girded, but hid are the edges blue,</span>
<span class="i0">As he wendeth his ways to the mountains, and rideth the horse-mead through.</span>
<span class="i0">His wide grey eyes are happy, and his voice is sweet and soft,</span>
<span class="i0">As amid the mead-lark's singing he casteth song aloft:</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, lo, the horse and the rider! So once maybe it was,</span>
<span class="i0">When over the Earth unpeopled the youngest God would pass;</span>
<span class="i0">But never again meseemeth shall such a sight betide,</span>
<span class="i0">Till over a world unwrongful new-born shall Baldur ride.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So he comes to that ness of the mountains, and Gripir's garden steep,</span>
<span class="i0">That bravely Greyfell breasteth, and adown by the door doth he leap</span>
<span class="i0">And his war-gear rattleth upon him; there is none to ask or forbid</span>
<span class="i0">As he wendeth the house clear-lighted, where no mote of the dust is hid,</span>
<span class="i0">Though the sunlight hath not entered: the walls are clear and bright,</span>
<span class="i0">For they cast back each to other the golden Sigurd's light;</span>
<span class="i0">Through the echoing ways of the house bright-eyed he wendeth along,</span>
<span class="i0">And the mountain-wind is with him, and the hovering eagles' song;</span>
<span class="i0">But no sound of the children of men may the ears of the Volsung hear,</span>
<span class="i0">And no sign of their ways in the world, or their will, or their hope or their fear.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So he comes to the hall of Gripir, and gleaming-green is it built</span>
<span class="i0">As the house of under-ocean where the wealth of the greedy is spilt;</span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming and green as the sea, and rich as its rock-strewn floor,</span>
<span class="i0">And fresh as the autumn morning when the burning of summer is o'er.</span>
<span class="i0">There he looks and beholdeth the high-seat, and he sees it strangely wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">Of the tooth of the sea-beast fashioned ere the Dwarf-kind came to nought;</span>
<span class="i0">And he looks, and thereon is Gripir, the King exceeding old,</span>
<span class="i0">With the sword of his fathers girded, and his raiment wrought of gold;</span>
<span class="i0">With the ivory rod in his right-hand, with his left on the crystal laid,</span>
<span class="i0">That is round as the world of men-folk, and after its image made,</span>
<span class="i0">And clear is it wrought to the eyen that may read therein of Fate</span>
<span class="i0">Though little indeed be its sea, and its earth not wondrous great.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">There Sigurd stands in the hall, on the sheathed Wrath doth he lean,</span>
<span class="i0">All his golden light is mirrored in the gleaming floor and green;</span>
<span class="i0">But the smile in his face upriseth as he looks on the ancient King,</span>
<span class="i0">And their glad eyes meet and their laughter, and sweet is the welcoming:</span>
<span class="i0">And Gripir saith: "Hail Sigurd! for my bidding hast thou done,</span>
<span class="i0">And here in the mountain-dwelling are two Kings of men alone."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Sigurd spake: "Hail father! I am girt with the fateful sword</span>
<span class="i0">And my face is set to the highway, and I come for thy latest word."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said Gripir: "What wouldst thou hearken ere we sit and drink the wine?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thy word and the Norns'," said Sigurd, "but never a word of mine."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What sights wouldst thou see," said Gripir, "ere mine hand shall take thine hand?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"As the Gods would I see," said Sigurd, "though Death light up the land."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What hope wouldst thou hope, O Sigurd, ere we kiss, we twain, and depart?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thy hope and the Gods'," said Sigurd, "though the grief lie hard on my heart."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Nought answered the ancient wise-one, and not a whit had he stirred</span>
<span class="i0">Since the clash of Sigurd's raiment in his mountain-hall he heard;</span>
<span class="i0">But the ball that imaged the earth was set in his hand grown old;</span>
<span class="i0">And belike it was to his vision, as the wide-world's ocean rolled,</span>
<span class="i0">And the forests waved with the wind, and the corn was gay with the lark,</span>
<span class="i0">And the gold in its nether places grew up in the dusk and the dark,</span>
<span class="i0">And its children built and departed, and its King-folk conquered and went,</span>
<span class="i0">As over the crystal image his all-wise face was bent:</span>
<span class="i0">For all his desire was dead, and he lived as a God shall live,</span>
<span class="i0">Who the prayers of the world hath forgotten, and to whom no hand may give.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But there stood the mighty Volsung, and leaned on the hidden Wrath;</span>
<span class="i0">As the earliest sun's uprising o'er the sea-plain draws a path</span>
<span class="i0">Whereby men sail to the Eastward and the dawn of another day,</span>
<span class="i0">So the image of King Sigurd on the gleaming pavement lay.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then great in the hall fair-pillared the voice of Gripir arose,</span>
<span class="i0">And it ran through the glimmering house-ways, and forth to the sunny close;</span>
<span class="i0">There mid the birds' rejoicing went the voice of an o'er-wise King</span>
<span class="i0">Like a wind of midmost winter come back to talk with spring.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But the voice cried: "Sigurd, Sigurd! O great, O early born!</span>
<span class="i0">O hope of the Kings first fashioned! O blossom of the morn!</span>
<span class="i0">Short day and long remembrance, fair summer of the North!</span>
<span class="i0">One day shall the worn world wonder how first thou wentest forth!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Arise, O Sigurd, Sigurd! in the night arise and go,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt smite when the day-dawn glimmers through the folds of God-home's foe:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"There the child in the noon-tide smiteth; the young King rendeth apart,</span>
<span class="i0">The old guile by the guile encompassed, the heart made wise by the heart.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd; bind up to cast abroad!</span>
<span class="i0">That the earth may laugh before thee rejoiced by the Waters' Hoard.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Ride on, O Sigurd, Sigurd! for God's word goes forth on the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">And he speaketh not twice over; nor shall they loose that bind:</span>
<span class="i0">But the Day and the Day shall loosen, and the Day shall awake and arise,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Day shall rejoice with the Dawning, and the wise heart learn of the wise.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O fair, O fearless, O mighty, how green are the garths of Kings,</span>
<span class="i0">How soft are the ways before thee to the heart of their war-farings!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"How green are the garths of King-folk, how fair is the lily and rose</span>
<span class="i0">In the house of the Cloudy People, 'neath the towers of kings and foes!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Smite now, smite now in the noontide! ride on through the hosts of men!</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the dear remembrance perish, and today come not again.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Is it day?&mdash;But the house is darkling&mdash;But the hand would gather and hold,</span>
<span class="i0">And the lips have kissed the cloud-wreath, and a cloud the arms enfold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"In the dusk hath the Sower arisen; in the dark hath he cast the seed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the ear is the sorrow of Odin and the wrong, and the nameless need!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Ah the hand hath gathered and garnered, and empty is the hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Though the day be full and fruitful mid the drift of the Cloudy Land!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Look, look on the drift of the clouds, how the day and the even doth grow</span>
<span class="i0">As the long-forgotten dawning that was a while ago!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Dawn, dawn, O mighty of men! and why wilt thou never awake,</span>
<span class="i0">When the holy field of the Goth-folk cries out for thy love and thy sake?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Dawn, now; but the house is silent, and dark is the purple blood</span>
<span class="i0">On the breast of the Queen fair-fashioned; and it riseth up as a flood</span>
<span class="i0">Round the posts of the door belov&egrave;d; and a deed there lieth therein:</span>
<span class="i0">The last of the deeds of Sigurd; the worst of the Cloudy Kin&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The slayer slain by the slain within the door and without.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;O dawn as the eve of the birth-day! O dark world cumbered with doubt!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Shall it never be day any more, nor the sun's uprising and growth?</span>
<span class="i0">Shall the kings of earth lie sleeping and the war-dukes wander in sloth</span>
<span class="i0">Through the last of the winter twilight? is the word of the wise-ones said</span>
<span class="i0">Till the five-fold winter be ended and the trumpet waken the dead?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Short day and long remembrance! great glory for the earth!</span>
<span class="i0">O deeds of the Day triumphant! O word of Sigurd's worth!</span>
<span class="i0">It is done, and who shall undo it of all who were ever alive?</span>
<span class="i0">May the Gods or the high Gods' masters 'gainst the tale of the righteous strive,</span>
<span class="i0">And the deeds to follow after, and all their deeds increase,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the uttermost field is foughten, and Baldur riseth in peace!</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Cry out, O waste, before him! O rocks of the wilderness, cry!</span>
<span class="i0">For to-morn shalt thou see the glory, and the man not made to die!</span>
<span class="i0">Cry out, O upper heavens! O clouds beneath the lift</span>
<span class="i0">For the golden King shall be riding high-headed midst the drift:</span>
<span class="i0">The mountain waits and the fire; there waiteth the heart of the wise</span>
<span class="i0">Till the earthly toil is accomplished, and again shall the fire arise;</span>
<span class="i0">And none shall be nigh in the ending and none by his heart shall be laid,</span>
<span class="i0">Save the world that he cherished and quickened, and the Day that he wakened and made."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So died the voice of Gripir from amidst the sunny close,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sound of hastening eagles from the mountain's feet arose,</span>
<span class="i0">But the hall was silent a little, for still stood Sigmund's son,</span>
<span class="i0">And he heard the words and remembered, and knew them one by one.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he turned on the ancient Gripir with eyes that knew no guile</span>
<span class="i0">And smiled on the wise of King-folk as the first of men might smile</span>
<span class="i0">On the God that hath fashioned him happy; and he spake:</span>
<span class="i8">"Hast thou spoken and known</span>
<span class="i0">How there standeth a child before thee and a stripling scarcely grown?</span>
<span class="i0">Or hast thou told of the Volsungs, and the gathered heart of these,</span>
<span class="i0">And their still unquenched desire for garnering fame's increase?</span>
<span class="i0">E'en so do I hearken thy words: for I wot how they deem it long</span>
<span class="i0">Till a man from their seed be arisen to deal with the cumber and wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">Bid me therefore to sit by thy side, for behold I wend on my way,</span>
<span class="i0">And the gates swing to behind me, and each day of mine is a day</span>
<span class="i0">With deeds in the eve and the morning, nor deeds shall the noontide lack;</span>
<span class="i0">To the right and the left none calleth, and no voice crieth aback."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Come, kin of the Gods," said Gripir, "come up and sit by my side</span>
<span class="i0">That we twain may be glad as the fearless, and they that have nothing to hide:</span>
<span class="i0">I have wrought out my will and abide it, and I sit ungrieved and alone,</span>
<span class="i0">I look upon men and I help not; to me are the deeds long done</span>
<span class="i0">As those of to-day and to-morrow: for these and for those am I glad;</span>
<span class="i0">But the Gods and men are the framers, and the days of my life I have had."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd came unto Gripir, and he kissed the wise-one's face,</span>
<span class="i0">And they sat in the high-seat together, the child and the elder of days;</span>
<span class="i0">And they drank of the wine of King-folk, and were joyful each of each,</span>
<span class="i0">And spake for a while of matters that are meet for King-folk's speech;</span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of men that have been and Kin of the Kings of the earth;</span>
<span class="i0">And Gripir told of the outlands, and the mid-world's billowy girth,</span>
<span class="i0">And tales of the upper heaven were mingled with his talk,</span>
<span class="i0">And the halls where the Sea-Queen's kindred o'er the gem-strewn pavement walk,</span>
<span class="i0">And the innermost parts of the earth, where they lie, the green and the blue,</span>
<span class="i0">And the red and the glittering gem-stones that of old the Dwarf-kind knew.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Long Sigurd sat and marvelled at the mouth that might not lie,</span>
<span class="i0">And the eyes no God had blinded, and the lone heart raised on high,</span>
<span class="i0">Then he rose from the gleaming high-seat, and the rings of battle rang</span>
<span class="i0">And the sheath&egrave;d Wrath was hearkening and a song of war it sang,</span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd spake unto Gripir:</span>
<span class="i8">"Long and lovely are thy days,</span>
<span class="i0">And thy years fulfilled of wisdom, and thy feet on the unhid ways,</span>
<span class="i0">And the guileless heart of the great that knoweth not anger nor pain:</span>
<span class="i0">So once hath a man been fashioned and shall not be again.</span>
<span class="i0">But for me hath been foaled the war-horse, the grey steed swift as the cloud,</span>
<span class="i0">And for me were the edges smithied, and the Wrath cries out aloud;</span>
<span class="i0">And a voice hath called from the darkness, and I ride to the Glittering Heath;</span>
<span class="i0">To smite on the door of Destruction, and waken the warder of Death."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So they kissed, the wise and the wise, and the child from the elder turned;</span>
<span class="i0">And again in the glimmering house-ways the golden Sigurd burned;</span>
<span class="i0">He stood outside in the sunlight, and tarried never a deal,</span>
<span class="i0">But leapt on the cloudy Greyfell with the clank of gold and steel,</span>
<span class="i0">And he rode through the sinking day to the walls of the kingly stead,</span>
<span class="i0">And came to Regin's dwelling when the wind was fallen dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And the great sun just departing: then blood-red grew the west,</span>
<span class="i0">And the fowl flew home from the sea-mead, and all things sank to rest.</span>
</div></div>

<h4><i>Sigurd rideth to the Glittering Heath.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again on the morrow morning doth Sigurd the Volsung ride,</span>
<span class="i0">And Regin, the Master of Masters, is faring by his side,</span>
<span class="i0">And they leave the dwelling of kings and ride the summer land,</span>
<span class="i0">Until at the eve of the day the hills are on either hand:</span>
<span class="i0">Then they wend up higher and higher, and over the heaths they fare</span>
<span class="i0">Till the moon shines broad on the midnight, and they sleep 'neath the heavens bare;</span>
<span class="i0">And they waken and look behind them, and lo, the dawning of day</span>
<span class="i0">And the little land of the Helper and its valley far away;</span>
<span class="i0">But the mountains rise before them, a wall exceeding great.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the Master of Masters: "We have come to the garth and the gate:</span>
<span class="i0">There is youth and rest behind thee and many a thing to do,</span>
<span class="i0">There is many a fond desire, and each day born anew;</span>
<span class="i0">And the land of the Volsungs to conquer, and many a people's praise:</span>
<span class="i0">And for me there is rest it maybe, and the peaceful end of days.</span>
<span class="i0">We have come to the garth and the gate; to the hall-door now shall we win,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall we go to look on the high-seat and see what sitteth therein?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yea and what else?" said Sigurd, "was thy tale but mockeries</span>
<span class="i0">And have I been drifted hither on a wind of empty lies?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"It was sooth, it was sooth," said Regin, "and more might I have told</span>
<span class="i0">Had I heart and space to remember the deeds of the days of old."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And he hung down his head as he spake it, and was silent a little space;</span>
<span class="i0">And when it was lifted again there was fear in the Dwarf-king's face.</span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Thou knowest my thought, and wise-hearted art thou grown:</span>
<span class="i0">It were well if thine eyes were blinder, and we each were faring alone,</span>
<span class="i0">And I with my eld and my wisdom, and thou with thy youth and thy might;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet whiles I dream I have wrought thee, a beam of the morning bright,</span>
<span class="i0">A fatherless motherless glory, to work out my desire;</span>
<span class="i0">Then high my hope ariseth, and my heart is all afire</span>
<span class="i0">For the world I behold from afar, and the day that yet shall be;</span>
<span class="i0">Then I wake and all things I remember and a youth of the Kings I see&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;The child of the Wood-abider, the seed of a conquered King,</span>
<span class="i0">The sword that the Gods have fashioned, the fate that men shall sing:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Ah might the world run backward to the days of the Dwarfs of old,</span>
<span class="i0">When I hewed out the pillars of crystal, and smoothed the walls of gold!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Nought answered the Son of Sigmund; nay he heard him nought at all,</span>
<span class="i0">Save as though the wind were speaking in the bights of the mountain-hall:</span>
<span class="i0">But he leapt aback of Greyfell, and the glorious sun rose up,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heavens glowed above him like the bowl of Baldur's cup,</span>
<span class="i0">And a golden man was he waxen; as the heart of the sun he seemed,</span>
<span class="i0">While over the feet of the mountains like blood the new light streamed;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd cried to Greyfell and swift for the pass he rode</span>
<span class="i0">And Regin followed after as a man bowed down by a load.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Day-long they fared through the mountains, and that highway's fashioner</span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth was a fearful craftsman, and his hands the waters were,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heaped-up ice was his mattock, and the fire-blast was his man,</span>
<span class="i0">And never a whit he heeded though his walls were waste and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">And the guest-halls of that wayside great heaps of the ashes spent.</span>
<span class="i0">But, each as a man alone, through the sun-bright day they went,</span>
<span class="i0">And they rode till the moon rose upward, and the stars were small and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Then they slept on the long-slaked ashes beneath the heavens bare;</span>
<span class="i0">And the cold dawn came and they wakened, and the King of the Dwarf-kind seemed</span>
<span class="i0">As a thing of that wan land fashioned; but Sigurd glowed and gleamed</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the shadowless twilight by Greyfell's cloudy flank,</span>
<span class="i0">As a little space they abided while the latest star-world shrank;</span>
<span class="i0">On the backward road looked Regin and heard how Sigurd drew</span>
<span class="i0">The girths of Greyfell's saddle, and the voice of his sword he knew</span>
<span class="i0">And he feared to look on the Volsung, as thus he fell to speak:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I have seen the Dwarf-folk mighty, I have seen the God-folk weak;</span>
<span class="i0">And now, though our might be minished, yet have we gifts to give.</span>
<span class="i0">When men desire and conquer, most sweet is their life to live;</span>
<span class="i0">When men are young and lovely there is many a thing to do,</span>
<span class="i0">And sweet is their fond desire and the dawn that springs anew."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"This gift," said the Son of Sigmund, "the Norns shall give me yet,</span>
<span class="i0">And no blossom slain by the sunshine while the leaves with dew are wet."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin turned and beheld him: "Thou shalt deem it hard and strange,</span>
<span class="i0">When the hand hath encompassed it all, and yet thy life must change.</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, long were the lives of men-folk, if betwixt the Gods and them</span>
<span class="i0">Were mighty warders watching mid the earth's and the heaven's hem!</span>
<span class="i0">Is there any man so mighty he would cast this gift away,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The heart's desire accomplished, and life so long a day,</span>
<span class="i0">That the dawn should be forgotten ere the even was begun?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd laughed and answered: "Fare forth, O glorious sun;</span>
<span class="i0">Bright end from bright beginning, and the mid-way good to tell,</span>
<span class="i0">And death, and deeds accomplished, and all remembered well!</span>
<span class="i0">Shall the day go past and leave us, and we be left with night,</span>
<span class="i0">To tread the endless circle, and strive in vain to smite?</span>
<span class="i0">But thou&mdash;wilt thou still look backward? thou sayst I know thy thought:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast whetted the sword for the slaying, it shall turn aside for nought.</span>
<span class="i0">Fear not! with the Gold and the wisdom thou shalt deem thee God alone,</span>
<span class="i0">And mayst do and undo at pleasure, nor be bound by right nor wrong:</span>
<span class="i0">And then, if no God I be waxen, I shall be the weak with the strong."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And his war-gear clanged and tinkled as he leapt to the saddle-stead:</span>
<span class="i0">And the sun rose up at their backs and the grey world changed to red.</span>
<span class="i0">And away to the west went Sigurd by the glory wreathed about,</span>
<span class="i0">But little and black was Regin as a fire that dieth out.</span>
<span class="i0">Day-long they rode the mountains by the crags exceeding old,</span>
<span class="i0">And the ash that the first of the Dwarf-kind found dull and quenched and cold.</span>
<span class="i0">Then the moon in the mid-sky swam, and the stars were fair and pale,</span>
<span class="i0">And beneath the naked heaven they slept in an ash-grey dale;</span>
<span class="i0">And again at the dawn-dusk's ending they stood upon their feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd donned his war-gear nor his eyes would Regin meet.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">A clear streak widened in heaven low down above the earth;</span>
<span class="i0">And above it lay the cloud-flecks, and the sun, anigh its birth,</span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, their hosts was staining with the very hue of blood,</span>
<span class="i0">And ruddy by Greyfell's shoulder the Son of Sigmund stood.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the Master of Masters: "What is thine hope this morn</span>
<span class="i0">That thou dightest thee, O Sigurd, to ride this world forlorn?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What needeth hope," said Sigurd, "when the heart of the Volsungs turns</span>
<span class="i0">To the light of the Glittering Heath, and the house where the Waster burns?</span>
<span class="i0">I shall slay the Foe of the Gods, as thou badst me a while agone,</span>
<span class="i0">And then with the Gold and its wisdom shalt thou be left alone."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O Child," said the King of the Dwarf-kind, "when the day at last comes round</span>
<span class="i0">For the dread and the Dusk of the Gods, and the kin of the Wolf is unbound,</span>
<span class="i0">When thy sword shall hew the fire, and the wildfire beateth thy shield,</span>
<span class="i0">Shalt thou praise the wages of hope and the Gods that pitched the field?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O Foe of the Gods," said Sigurd, "wouldst thou hide the evil thing,</span>
<span class="i0">And the curse that is greater than thou, lest death end thy labouring,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the night should come upon thee amidst thy toil for nought?</span>
<span class="i0">It is me, it is me that thou fearest, if indeed I know thy thought;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea me, who would utterly light the face of all good and ill,</span>
<span class="i0">If not with the fruitful beams that the summer shall fulfill,</span>
<span class="i0">Then at least with the world a-blazing, and the glare of the grinded sword."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And he sprang aloft to the saddle as he spake the latest word,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Wrath sang loud in the sheath as it ne'er had sung before,</span>
<span class="i0">And the cloudy flecks were scattered like flames on the heaven's floor,</span>
<span class="i0">And all was kindled at once, and that trench of the mountains grey</span>
<span class="i0">Was filled with the living light as the low sun lit the way:</span>
<span class="i0">But Regin turned from the glory with blinded eyes and dazed,</span>
<span class="i0">And lo, on the cloudy war-steed how another light there blazed,</span>
<span class="i0">And a great voice came from amidst it:</span>
<span class="i8">"O Regin, in good sooth,</span>
<span class="i0">I have hearkened not nor heeded the words of thy fear and thy ruth:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast told thy tale and thy longing, and thereto I hearkened well:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Let it lead thee up to heaven, let it lead thee down to hell,</span>
<span class="i0">The deed shall be done to-morrow: thou shalt have that measureless Gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And devour the garnered wisdom that blessed thy realm of old,</span>
<span class="i0">That hath lain unspent and begrudged in the very heart of hate:</span>
<span class="i0">With the blood and the might of thy brother thine hunger shalt thou sate;</span>
<span class="i0">And this deed shall be mine and thine; but take heed for what followeth then!</span>
<span class="i0">Let each do after his kind! I shall do the deeds of men;</span>
<span class="i0">I shall harvest the field of their sowing, in the bed of their strewing shall sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">To them shall I give my life-days, to the Gods my glory to keep.</span>
<span class="i0">But thou with the wealth and the wisdom that the best of the Gods might praise,</span>
<span class="i0">If thou shalt indeed excel them and become the hope of the days,</span>
<span class="i0">Then me in turn hast thou conquered, and I shall be in turn</span>
<span class="i0">Thy fashioned brand of the battle through good and evil to burn,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the flame that sleeps in thy stithy for the gathered winds to blow,</span>
<span class="i0">When thou listest to do and undo and thine uttermost cunning to show.</span>
<span class="i0">But indeed I wot full surely that thou shalt follow thy kind;</span>
<span class="i0">And for all that cometh after, the Norns shall loose and bind."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then his bridle-reins rang sweetly, and the warding-walls of death,</span>
<span class="i0">And Regin drew up to him, and the Wrath sang loud in the sheath,</span>
<span class="i0">And forth from that trench in the mountains by the westward way they ride;</span>
<span class="i0">And little and black goes Regin by the golden Volsung's side;</span>
<span class="i0">But no more his head is drooping, for he seeth the Elf-king's Gold;</span>
<span class="i0">The garnered might and the wisdom e'en now his eyes behold.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So up and up they journeyed, and ever as they went</span>
<span class="i0">About the cold-slaked forges, o'er many a cloud-swept bent,</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the walls of blackness, by shores of the fishless meres,</span>
<span class="i0">And the fathomless desert waters, did Regin cast his fears,</span>
<span class="i0">And wrap him in desire; and all alone he seemed</span>
<span class="i0">As a God to his heirship wending, and forgotten and undreamed</span>
<span class="i0">Was all the tale of Sigurd, and the folk he had toiled among,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Volsungs, Odin's children, and the men-folk fair and young.</span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So on they ride to the westward, and huge were the mountains grown</span>
<span class="i0">And the floor of heaven was mingled with that tossing world of stone:</span>
<span class="i0">And they rode till the noon was forgotten and the sun was waxen low,</span>
<span class="i0">And they tarried not, though he perished, and the world grew dark below.</span>
<span class="i0">Then they rode a mighty desert, a glimmering place and wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And into a narrow pass high-walled on either side</span>
<span class="i0">By the blackness of the mountains, and barred aback and in face</span>
<span class="i0">By the empty night of the shadow; a windless silent place:</span>
<span class="i0">But the white moon shone o'erhead mid the small sharp stars and pale,</span>
<span class="i0">And each as a man alone they rode on the highway of bale.</span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So ever they wended upward, and the midnight hour was o'er,</span>
<span class="i0">And the stars grew pale and paler, and failed from the heaven's floor,</span>
<span class="i0">And the moon was a long while dead, but there was the promise of day,</span>
<span class="i0">No change came over the darkness, no streak of the dawning grey;</span>
<span class="i0">No sound of the wind's uprising adown the night there ran:</span>
<span class="i0">It was blind as the Gaping Gulf ere the first of the worlds began.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then athwart and athwart rode Sigurd and sought the walls of the pass,</span>
<span class="i0">But found no wall before him; and the road rang hard as brass</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the hoofs of Greyfell, as up and up he trod:</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Was it the daylight of Hell, or the night of the doorways of God?</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But lo, at the last a glimmer, and a light from the west there came,</span>
<span class="i0">And another and another, like points of far-off flame;</span>
<span class="i0">And they grew and brightened and gathered; and whiles together they ran</span>
<span class="i0">Like the moonwake over the waters; and whiles they were scant and wan,</span>
<span class="i0">Some greater and some lesser, like the boats of fishers laid</span>
<span class="i0">About the sea of midnight; and a dusky dawn they made,</span>
<span class="i0">A faint and glimmering twilight: So Sigurd strains his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And he sees how a land deserted all round about him lies</span>
<span class="i0">More changeless than mid-ocean, as fruitless as its floor:</span>
<span class="i0">Then the heart leaps up within him, for he knows that his journey is o'er,</span>
<span class="i0">And there he draweth bridle on the first of the Glittering Heath:</span>
<span class="i0">And the Wrath is waxen merry and sings in the golden sheath</span>
<span class="i0">As he leaps adown from Greyfell, and stands upon his feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And wends his ways through the twilight the Foe of the Gods to meet.</span>
</div></div>

<h4><i>Sigurd slayeth Fafnir the Serpent</i>.</h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought Sigurd seeth of Regin, and nought he heeds of him,</span>
<span class="i0">As in watchful might and glory he strides the desert dim,</span>
<span class="i0">And behind him paceth Greyfell; but he deems the time o'erlong</span>
<span class="i0">Till he meet the great gold-warden, the over-lord of wrong.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So he wendeth midst the silence through the measureless desert place,</span>
<span class="i0">And beholds the countless glitter with wise and steadfast face,</span>
<span class="i0">Till him-seems in a little season that the flames grow somewhat wan,</span>
<span class="i0">And a grey thing glimmers before him, and becomes a mighty man,</span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and ancient-seeming, in cloud-grey raiment clad;</span>
<span class="i0">A friendly man and glorious, and of visage smiling-glad:</span>
<span class="i0">Then content in Sigurd groweth because of his majesty,</span>
<span class="i0">And he heareth him speak in the desert as the wind of the winter sea:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Hail Sigurd! Give me thy greeting ere thy ways alone thou wend!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said Sigurd: "Hail! I greet thee, my friend and my fathers' friend."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Now whither away," said the elder, "with the Steed and the ancient Sword?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"To the greedy house," said Sigurd, "and the King of the Heavy Hoard."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou smite, O Sigurd, Sigurd?" said the ancient mighty-one.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yea, yea, I shall smite," said the Volsung, "save the Gods have slain the sun."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What wise wilt thou smite," said the elder, "lest the dark devour thy day?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thou hast praised the sword," said the child, "and the sword shall find a way."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Be learned of me," said the Wise-one, "for I was the first of thy folk."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said the child: "I shall do thy bidding, and for thee shall I strike the stroke."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Spake the Wise-one: "Thus shalt thou do when thou wendest hence alone:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt find a path in the desert, and a road in the world of stone;</span>
<span class="i0">It is smooth and deep and hollow, but the rain hath riven it not,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wild wind hath not worn it, for it is but Fafnir's slot,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereby he wends to the water and the fathomless pool of old,</span>
<span class="i0">When his heart in the dawn is weary, and he loathes the Ancient Gold:</span>
<span class="i0">There think of the great and the fathers, and bare the whetted Wrath,</span>
<span class="i0">And dig a pit in the highway, and a grave in the Serpent's path:</span>
<span class="i0">Lie thou therein, O Sigurd, and thine hope from the glooming hide,</span>
<span class="i0">And be as the dead for a season, and the living light abide!</span>
<span class="i0">And so shall thine heart avail thee, and thy mighty fateful hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Light that lay in the Branstock, the well belov&egrave;d brand."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Said the child: "I shall do thy bidding, and for thee shall I strike the stroke;</span>
<span class="i0">For I love thee, friend of my fathers, Wise Heart of the holy folk."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So spake the Son of Sigmund, and beheld no man anear,</span>
<span class="i0">And again was the night the midnight, and the twinkling flames shone clear</span>
<span class="i0">In the hush of the Glittering Heath; and alone went Sigmund's son</span>
<span class="i0">Till he came to the road of Fafnir, and the highway worn by one,</span>
<span class="i0">By the drift of the rain unfurrowed, by the windy years unrent,</span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the dark it came, and into the dark it went.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Great then was the heart of Sigurd, for there in the midmost he stayed,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought of the ancient fathers, and bared the bright blue blade,</span>
<span class="i0">That shone as a fleck of the day-light, and the night was all around.</span>
<span class="i0">Fair then was the Son of Sigmund as he toiled and laboured the ground;</span>
<span class="i0">Great, mighty he was in his working, and the Glittering Heath he clave,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sword shone blue before him as he dug the pit and the grave:</span>
<span class="i0">There he hid his hope from the night-tide and lay like one of the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And wise and wary he bided; and the heavens hung over his head.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Now the night wanes over Sigurd, and the ruddy rings he sees,</span>
<span class="i0">And his war-gear's fair adornment, and the God-folk's images;</span>
<span class="i0">But a voice in the desert ariseth, a sound in the waste has birth,</span>
<span class="i0">A changing tinkle and clatter, as of gold dragged over the earth:</span>
<span class="i0">O'er Sigurd widens the day-light, and the sound is drawing close,</span>
<span class="i0">And speedier than the trample of speedy feet it goes;</span>
<span class="i0">But ever deemeth Sigurd that the sun brings back the day,</span>
<span class="i0">For the grave grows lighter and lighter and heaven o'erhead is grey.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But now, how the rattling waxeth till he may not heed nor hark!</span>
<span class="i0">And the day and the heavens are hidden, and o'er Sigurd rolls the dark,</span>
<span class="i0">As the flood of a pitchy river, and heavy-thick is the air</span>
<span class="i0">With the venom of hate long hoarded, and lies once fashioned fair:</span>
<span class="i0">Then a wan face comes from the darkness, and is wrought in manlike wise,</span>
<span class="i0">And the lips are writhed with laughter and bleared are the blinded eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">And it wandereth hither and thither, and searcheth through the grave</span>
<span class="i0">And departeth, leaving nothing, save the dark, rolled wave on wave</span>
<span class="i0">O'er the golden head of Sigurd and the edges of the sword,</span>
<span class="i0">And the world weighs heavy on Sigurd, and the weary curse of the Hoard:</span>
<span class="i0">Him-seemed the grave grew straiter, and his hope of life grew chill,</span>
<span class="i0">And his heart by the Worm was enfolded, and the bonds of the Ancient Ill.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then was Sigurd stirred by his glory, and he strove with the swaddling of Death;</span>
<span class="i0">He turned in the pit on the highway, and the grave of the Glittering Heath;</span>
<span class="i0">He laughed and smote with the laughter and thrust up over his head,</span>
<span class="i0">And smote the venom asunder, and clave the heart of Dread;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he leapt from the pit and the grave, and the rushing river of blood,</span>
<span class="i0">And fulfilled with the joy of the War-God on the face of earth he stood</span>
<span class="i0">With red sword high uplifted, with wrathful glittering eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">And he laughed at the heavens above him for he saw the sun arise,</span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd gleamed on the desert, and shone in the new-born light,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wind in his raiment wavered, and all the world was bright.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But there was the ancient Fafnir, and the Face of Terror lay</span>
<span class="i0">On the huddled folds of the Serpent, that were black and ashen-grey</span>
<span class="i0">In the desert lit by the sun; and those twain looked each on each,</span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the Face of Terror went a sound of dreadful speech:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Child, child, who art thou that hast smitten? bright child, of whence is thy birth?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I am called the Wild-thing Glorious, and alone I wend on the earth."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Fierce child, and who was thy father?&mdash;Thou hast cleft the heart of the Foe!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Am I like to the sons of men-folk, that my father I should know?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Wert thou born of a nameless wonder? shall the lies to my death-day cling?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"How lieth Sigurd the Volsung, and the Son of Sigmund the King?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O bitter father of Sigurd!&mdash;thou hast cleft mine heart atwain!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I arose, and I wondered and wended, and I smote, and I smote not in vain."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What master hath taught thee of murder?&mdash;Thou hast wasted Fafnir's day."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I, Sigurd, knew and desired, and the bright sword learned the way."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thee, thee shall the rattling Gold and the red rings bring to the bane."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yet mine hand shall cast them abroad, and the earth shall gather again."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I see thee great in thine anger, and the Norns thou heedest not."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O Fafnir, speak of the Norns and the wisdom unforgot!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Let the death-doomed flee from the ocean, him the wind and the weather shall drown."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O Fafnir, tell of the Norns ere thy life thou layest adown!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O manifold is their kindred, and who shall tell them all?</span>
<span class="i0">There are they that rule o'er men-folk and the stars that rise and fall:</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I knew of the folk of the Dwarfs, and I knew their Norns of old;</span>
<span class="i0">And I fought, and I fell in the morning, and I die afar from the gold:</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I have seen the Gods of heaven, and their Norns withal I know:</span>
<span class="i0">They love and withhold their helping, they hate and refrain the blow;</span>
<span class="i0">They curse and they may not sunder, they bless and they shall not blend;</span>
<span class="i0">They have fashioned the good and the evil; they abide the change and the end."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O Fafnir, what of the Isle, and what hast thou known of its name,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the Gods shall mingle edges with Surt and the Sons of Flame?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O child, O Strong Compeller? Unshapen is its hight;</span>
<span class="i0">There the fallow blades shall be shaken and the Dark and the Day shall smite,</span>
<span class="i0">When the Bridge of the Gods is broken, and their white steeds swim the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And the uttermost field is stricken, last strife of thee and me."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"What then shall endure, O Fafnir, the tale of the battle to tell?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I am blind, O Strong Compeller, in the bonds of Death and Hell.</span>
<span class="i0">But thee shall the rattling Gold and the red rings bring unto bane."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yet the rings mine hand shall scatter, and the earth shall gather again."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Woe, woe! in the days passed over I bore the Helm of Dread,</span>
<span class="i0">I reared the Face of Terror, and the hoarded hate of the Dead:</span>
<span class="i0">I overcame and was mighty; I was wise and cherished my heart</span>
<span class="i0">In the waste where no man wandered, and the high house builded apart:</span>
<span class="i0">Till I met thine hand, O Sigurd, and thy might ordained from of old;</span>
<span class="i0">And I fought and fell in the morning, and I die far off from the Gold."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd leaned on his sword, and a dreadful voice went by</span>
<span class="i0">Like the wail of a God departing and the War-God's misery;</span>
<span class="i0">And strong words of ancient wisdom went by on the desert wind,</span>
<span class="i0">The words that mar and fashion, the words that loose and bind;</span>
<span class="i0">And sounds of a strange lamenting, and such strange things bewailed,</span>
<span class="i0">That words to tell their meaning the tongue of man hath failed.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then all sank into silence, and the Son of Sigmund stood</span>
<span class="i0">On the torn and furrowed desert by the pool of Fafnir's blood,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Serpent lay before him, dead, chilly, dull, and grey;</span>
<span class="i0">And over the Glittering Heath fair shone the sun and the day,</span>
<span class="i0">And a light wind followed the sun and breathed o'er the fateful place,</span>
<span class="i0">As fresh as it furrows the sea-plain or bows the acres' face.</span>

<h4><i>Sigurd slayeth Regin the Master of Masters on the Glittering Heath</i>.</h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There standeth Sigurd the Volsung, and leaneth on his sword,</span>
<span class="i0">And beside him now is Greyfell and looks on his golden lord,</span>
<span class="i0">And the world is awake and living; and whither now shall they wend,</span>
<span class="i0">Who have come to the Glittering Heath, and wrought that deed to its end?</span>
<span class="i0">For hither comes Regin the Master from the skirts of the field of death,</span>
<span class="i0">And he shadeth his eyes from the sunlight as afoot he goeth and saith:</span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, let me live for a while! for a while and all shall be well,</span>
<span class="i0">When passed is the house of murder and I creep from the prison of hell."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Afoot he went o'er the desert, and he came unto Sigurd and stared</span>
<span class="i0">At the golden gear of the man, and the Wrath yet bloody and bared,</span>
<span class="i0">And the light locks raised by the wind, and the eyes beginning to smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And the lovely lips of the Volsung, and the brow that knew no guile;</span>
<span class="i0">And he murmured under his breath while his eyes grew white with wrath:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O who art thou, and wherefore, and why art thou in the path?"</span>
<span class="i0">Then he turned to the ash-grey Serpent, and grovelled low on the ground,</span>
<span class="i0">And he drank of that pool of the blood where the stones of the wild were drowned,</span>
<span class="i0">And long he lapped as a dog; but when he arose again,</span>
<span class="i0">Lo, a flock of the mountain-eagles that drew to the feastful plain;</span>
<span class="i0">And he turned and looked on Sigurd, as bright in the sun he stood,</span>
<span class="i0">A stripling fair and slender, and wiped the Wrath of the blood.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Regin cried: "O Dwarf-kind, O many-shifting folk,</span>
<span class="i0">O shapes of might and wonder, am I too freed from the yoke,</span>
<span class="i0">That binds my soul to my body a withered thing forlorn,</span>
<span class="i0">While the short-lived fools of man-folk so fair and oft are born?</span>
<span class="i0">Now swift in the air shall I be, and young in the concourse of kings,</span>
<span class="i0">If my heart shall come to desire the gain of earthly things."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And he looked and saw how Sigurd was sheathing the Flame of War,</span>
<span class="i0">And the eagles screamed in the wind, but their voice came faint from afar:</span>
<span class="i0">Then he scowled, and crouched and darkened, and came to Sigurd and spake:</span>
<span class="i0">"O child, thou hast slain my brother, and the Wrath is alive and awake."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Thou sayest sooth," said Sigurd, "thy deed and mine is done:</span>
<span class="i0">But now our ways shall sunder, for here, meseemeth, the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Hath but little of deeds to do, and no love to win aback."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin crouched before him, and he spake: "Fare on to the wrack!</span>
<span class="i0">Fare on to the murder of men, and the deeds of thy kindred of old!</span>
<span class="i0">And surely of thee as of them shall the tale be speedily told.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast slain thy Master's brother, and what wouldst thou say thereto,</span>
<span class="i0">Were the judges met for the judging and the doom-ring hallowed due?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd spake as aforetime: "Thy deed and mine it was,</span>
<span class="i0">And now our ways shall sunder, and into the world will I pass."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Regin darkened before him, and exceeding grim was he grown,</span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Thou hast slain my brother, and wherewith wilt thou atone?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Stand up, O Master," said Sigurd, "O Singer of ancient days,</span>
<span class="i0">And take the wealth I have won thee, ere we wend on the sundering ways.</span>
<span class="i0">I have toiled and thou hast desired, and the Treasure is surely anear,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou hast wisdom to find it, and I have slain thy fear."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Regin crouched and darkened: "Thou hast slain my brother," he said.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Take thou the Gold," quoth Sigurd, "for the ransom of my head!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin crouched and darkened, and over the earth he hung;</span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Thou hast slain my brother, and the Gods are yet but young."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Bright Sigurd towered above him, and the Wrath cried out in the sheath,</span>
<span class="i0">And Regin writhed against it as the adder turns on death;</span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Thou hast slain my brother, and to-day shalt thou be my thrall:</span>
<span class="i0">Yea a King shall be my cook-boy and this heath my cooking-hall."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then he crept to the ash-grey coils where the life of his brother had lain,</span>
<span class="i0">And he drew a glaive from his side and smote the smitten and slain,</span>
<span class="i0">And tore the heart from Fafnir, while the eagles cried o'erhead,</span>
<span class="i0">And sharp and shrill was their voice o'er the entrails of the dead.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Regin spake to Sigurd: "Of this slaying wilt thou be free?</span>
<span class="i0">Then gather thou fire together and roast the heart for me,</span>
<span class="i0">That I may eat it and live, and be thy master and more;</span>
<span class="i0">For therein was might and wisdom, and the grudged and hoarded lore:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or else, depart on thy ways afraid from the Glittering Heath."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then he fell abackward and slept, nor set his sword in the sheath,</span>
<span class="i0">But his hand was red on the hilts and blue were the edges bared,</span>
<span class="i0">Ash-grey was his visage waxen, and with open eyes he stared</span>
<span class="i0">On the height of heaven above him, and a fearful thing he seemed,</span>
<span class="i0">As his soul went wide in the world, and of rule and kingship he dreamed.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But Sigurd took the Heart, and wood on the waste he found,</span>
<span class="i0">The wood that grew and died, as it crept on the niggard ground,</span>
<span class="i0">And grew and died again, and lay like whitened bones;</span>
<span class="i0">And the ernes cried over his head, as he builded his hearth of stones,</span>
<span class="i0">And kindled the fire for cooking, and sat and sang o'er the roast</span>
<span class="i0">The song of his fathers of old, and the Wolflings' gathering host:</span>
<span class="i0">So there on the Glittering Heath rose up the little flame,</span>
<span class="i0">And the dry sticks crackled amidst it, and alow the eagles came,</span>
<span class="i0">And seven they were by tale, and they pitched all round about</span>
<span class="i0">The cooking-fire of Sigurd, and sent their song-speech out:</span>
<span class="i0">But nought he knoweth its wisdom, or the word that they would speak:</span>
<span class="i0">And hot grew the Heart of Fafnir and sang amid the reek.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looketh on Regin, and he deemeth it overlong</span>
<span class="i0">That he dighteth the dear-bought morsel, and the might for the Master of wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">So he reacheth his hand to the roast to see if the cooking be o'er;</span>
<span class="i0">But the blood and the fat seethed from it and scalded his finger sore,</span>
<span class="i0">And he set his hand to his mouth to quench the fleshly smart,</span>
<span class="i0">And he tasted the flesh of the Serpent and the blood of Fafnir's Heart:</span>
<span class="i0">Then there came a change upon him, for the speech of fowl he knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And wise in the ways of the beast-kind as the Dwarfs of old he grew;</span>
<span class="i0">And he knitted his brows and hearkened, and wrath in his heart arose;</span>
<span class="i0">For he felt beset of evil in a world of many foes.</span>
<span class="i0">But the hilt of the Wrath he handled, and Regin's heart he saw,</span>
<span class="i0">And how that the Foe of the Gods the net of death would draw;</span>
<span class="i0">And his bright eyes flashed and sparkled, and his mouth grew set and stern</span>
<span class="i0">As he hearkened the voice of the eagles, and their song began to learn.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">For the first cried out in the desert: "O mighty Sigmund's son,</span>
<span class="i0">How long wilt thou sit and tarry now the dear-bought roast is done?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And the second: "Volsung, arise! for the horns blow up to the hall,</span>
<span class="i0">And dight are the purple hangings, and the King to the feasting should fall."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And the third: "How great is the feast if the eater eat aright</span>
<span class="i0">The Heart of the wisdom of old and the after-world's delight!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And the fourth: "Yea what of Regin? shall he scatter wrack o'er the world?</span>
<span class="i0">Shall the father be slain by the son, and the brother 'gainst brother be hurled?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And the fifth: "He hath taught a stripling the gifts of a God to give:</span>
<span class="i0">He hath reared up a King for the slaying, that he alone might live."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And the sixth: "He shall waken mighty as a God that scorneth a truth;</span>
<span class="i0">He hath drunk of the blood of the Serpent, and drowned all hope and ruth."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And the seventh: "Arise, O Sigurd, lest the hour be overlate!</span>
<span class="i0">For the sun in the mid-noon shineth, and swift is the hand of Fate:</span>
<span class="i0">Arise! lest the world run backward and the blind heart have its will,</span>
<span class="i0">And once again be tangled the sundered good and ill;</span>
<span class="i0">Lest love and hatred perish, lest the world forget its tale,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Gods sit deedless, dreaming, in the high-walled heavenly vale."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then swift ariseth Sigurd, and the Wrath in his hand is bare,</span>
<span class="i0">And he looketh, and Regin sleepeth, and his eyes wide-open glare;</span>
<span class="i0">But his lips smile false in his dreaming, and his hand is on the sword;</span>
<span class="i0">For he dreams himself the Master and the new world's fashioning-lord.</span>
<span class="i0">And his dream hath forgotten Sigurd, and the King's life lies in the pit;</span>
<span class="i0">He is nought; Death gnaweth upon him, while the Dwarfs in mastery sit.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But lo, how the eyes of Sigurd the heart of the guileful behold,</span>
<span class="i0">And great is Allfather Odin, and upriseth the Curse of the Gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Branstock bloometh to heaven from the ancient wondrous root;</span>
<span class="i0">The summer hath shone on its blossoms, and Sigurd's Wrath is the fruit:</span>
<span class="i0">Dread then he cried in the desert: "Guile-master, lo thy deed!</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou nurst my life for destruction, and my death to serve thy need?</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou kept me here for the net and the death that tame things die?</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou feared me overmuch, thou Foe of the Gods on high?</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the sword thine hand was wielding should turn about and cleave</span>
<span class="i0">The tangled web of nothing thou hadst wearied thyself to weave.</span>
<span class="i0">Lo here the sword and the stroke! judge the Norns betwixt us twain!</span>
<span class="i0">But for me, I will live and die not, nor shall all my hope be vain."</span>
<span class="i0">Then his second stroke struck Sigurd, for the Wrath flashed thin and white,</span>
<span class="i0">And 'twixt head and trunk of Regin fierce ran the fateful light;</span>
<span class="i0">And there lay brother by brother a faded thing and wan.</span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd cried in the desert: "So far have I wended on!</span>
<span class="i0">Dead are the foes of God-home that would blend the good and the ill;</span>
<span class="i0">And the World shall yet be famous, and the Gods shall have their will.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall I be dead and forgotten, while the earth grows worse and worse,</span>
<span class="i0">With the blind heart king o'er the people, and binding curse with curse."</span>
</div></div>

<h4><i>How Sigurd took to him the Treasure of the Elf Andvari.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sigurd eats of the heart that once in the Dwarf-king lay,</span>
<span class="i0">The hoard of the wisdom begrudged, the might of the earlier day.</span>
<span class="i0">Then wise of heart was he waxen, but longing in him grew</span>
<span class="i0">To sow the seed he had gotten, and till the field he knew.</span>
<span class="i0">So he leapeth aback of Greyfell, and rideth the desert bare,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hollow slot of Fafnir, that led to the Serpent's lair.</span>
<span class="i0">Then long he rode adown it, and the ernes flew overhead,</span>
<span class="i0">And tidings great and glorious of that Treasure of old they said.</span>
<span class="i0">So far o'er the waste he wended, and when the night was come</span>
<span class="i0">He saw the earth-old dwelling, the dread Gold-wallower's home:</span>
<span class="i0">On the skirts of the Heath it was builded by a tumbled stony bent;</span>
<span class="i0">High went that house to the heavens, down 'neath the earth it went,</span>
<span class="i0">Of unwrought iron fashioned for the heart of a greedy king:</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a mountain, blind without, and within was its plenishing</span>
<span class="i0">But the Hoard of Andvari the ancient, and the sleeping Curse unseen,</span>
<span class="i0">The Gold of the Gods that spared not and the greedy that have been.</span>
<span class="i0">Through the door strode Sigurd the Volsung, and the grey moon and the sword</span>
<span class="i0">Fell in on the tawny gold-heaps of the ancient hapless Hoard:</span>
<span class="i0">Gold gear of hosts unburied, and the coin of cities dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Great spoil of the ages of battle, lay there on the Serpent's bed:</span>
<span class="i0">Huge blocks from mid-earth quarried, where none but the Dwarfs have mined,</span>
<span class="i0">Wide sands of the golden rivers no foot of man may find</span>
<span class="i0">Lay 'neath the spoils of the mighty and the ruddy rings of yore:</span>
<span class="i0">But amidst was the Helm of Aweing that the Fear of earth-folk bore,</span>
<span class="i0">And there gleamed a wonder beside it, the Hauberk all of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose like is not in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told:</span>
<span class="i0">There Sigurd seeth moreover Andvari's Ring of Gain,</span>
<span class="i0">The hope of Loki's finger, the Ransom's utmost grain;</span>
<span class="i0">For it shone on the midmost gold-heap like the first star set in the sky</span>
<span class="i0">In the yellow space of even when moon-rise draweth anigh.</span>
<span class="i0">Then laughed the Son of Sigmund, and stooped to the golden land,</span>
<span class="i0">And gathered that first of the harvest and set it on his hand;</span>
<span class="i0">And he did on the Helm of Aweing, and the Hauberk all of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose like is not in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told:</span>
<span class="i0">Then he praised the day of the Volsungs amid the yellow light,</span>
<span class="i0">And he set his hand to the labour and put forth his kingly might;</span>
<span class="i0">He dragged forth gold to the moon, on the desert's face he laid</span>
<span class="i0">The innermost earth's adornment, and rings for the nameless made;</span>
<span class="i0">He toiled and loaded Greyfell, and the cloudy war-steed shone</span>
<span class="i0">And the gear of Sigurd rattled in the flood of moonlight wan;</span>
<span class="i0">There he toiled and loaded Greyfell, and the Volsung's armour rang</span>
<span class="i0">Mid the yellow bed of the Serpent: but without the eagles sang:</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! let the gold shine free and clear!</span>
<span class="i0">For what hath the Son of the Volsungs the ancient Curse to fear?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for thy tale is well begun,</span>
<span class="i0">And the world shall be good and gladdened by the Gold lit up by the sun."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd, and gladden all thine heart!</span>
<span class="i0">For the world shall make thee merry ere thou and she depart."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for the ways go green below,</span>
<span class="i0">Go green to the dwelling of Kings, and the halls that the Queen-folk know."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for what is there bides by the way,</span>
<span class="i0">Save the joy of folk to awaken, and the dawn of the merry day?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for the strife awaits thine hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And a plenteous war-field's reaping, and the praise of many a land."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! But how shall store-house hold</span>
<span class="i0">That glory of thy winning and the tidings to be told?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Now the moon was dead, and the star-worlds were great on the heavenly plain,</span>
<span class="i0">When the steed was fully laden; then Sigurd taketh the rein</span>
<span class="i0">And turns to the ruined rock-wall that the lair was built beneath,</span>
<span class="i0">For there he deemed was the gate and the door of the Glittering Heath,</span>
<span class="i0">But not a whit moved Greyfell for aught that the King might do;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd pondered a while, till the heart of the beast he knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And clad in all his war-gear he leaped to the saddle-stead,</span>
<span class="i0">And with pride and mirth neighed Greyfell and tossed aloft his head,</span>
<span class="i0">And sprang unspurred o'er the waste, and light and swift he went,</span>
<span class="i0">And breasted the broken rampart, the stony tumbled bent;</span>
<span class="i0">And over the brow he clomb, and there beyond was the world,</span>
<span class="i0">A place of many mountains and great crags together hurled.</span>
<span class="i0">So down to the west he wendeth, and goeth swift and light,</span>
<span class="i0">And the stars are beginning to wane, and the day is mingled with night;</span>
<span class="i0">For full fain was the sun to arise and look on the Gold set free,</span>
<span class="i0">And the Dwarf-wrought rings of the Treasure and the gifts from the floor of the sea.</span>

<h4><i>How Sigurd awoke Brynhild upon Hindfell.</i></h4>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By long roads rideth Sigurd amidst that world of stone,</span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat south he turneth; for he would not be alone,</span>
<span class="i0">But longs for the dwellings of man-folk, and the kingly people's speech,</span>
<span class="i0">And the days of the glee and the joyance, where men laugh each to each.</span>
<span class="i0">But still the desert endureth, and afar must Greyfell fare</span>
<span class="i0">From the wrack of the Glittering Heath, and Fafnir's golden lair.</span>
<span class="i0">Long Sigurd rideth the waste, when, lo, on a morning of day</span>
<span class="i0">From out of the tangled crag-walls, amidst the cloud-land grey</span>
<span class="i0">Comes up a mighty mountain, and it is as though there burns</span>
<span class="i0">A torch amidst of its cloud-wreath; so thither Sigurd turns,</span>
<span class="i0">For he deems indeed from its topmost to look on the best of the earth;</span>
<span class="i0">And Greyfell neigheth beneath him, and his heart is full of mirth.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So he rideth higher and higher, and the light grows great and strange,</span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the clouds it flickers, till at noon they gather and change,</span>
<span class="i0">And settle thick on the mountain, and hide its head from sight;</span>
<span class="i0">But the winds in a while are awakened, and day bettereth ere the night,</span>
<span class="i0">And, lifted a measureless mass o'er the desert crag-walls high,</span>
<span class="i0">Cloudless the mountain riseth against the sunset sky,</span>
<span class="i0">The sea of the sun grown golden, as it ebbs from the day's desire;</span>
<span class="i0">And the light that afar was a torch is grown a river of fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And the mountain is black above it, and below is it dark and dun;</span>
<span class="i0">And there is the head of Hindfell as an island in the sun.</span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Night falls, but yet rides Sigurd, and hath no thought of rest,</span>
<span class="i0">For he longs to climb that rock-world and behold the earth at its best;</span>
<span class="i0">But now mid the maze of the foot-hills he seeth the light no more,</span>
<span class="i0">And the stars are lovely and gleaming on the lightless heavenly floor.</span>
<span class="i0">So up and up he wendeth till the night is wearing thin;</span>
<span class="i0">And he rideth a rift of the mountain, and all is dark therein,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the stars are dimmed by dawning and the wakening world is cold;</span>
<span class="i0">Then afar in the upper rock-wall a breach doth he behold,</span>
<span class="i0">And a flood of light poured inward the doubtful dawning blinds:</span>
<span class="i0">So swift he rideth thither and the mouth of the breach he finds,</span>
<span class="i0">And sitteth awhile on Greyfell on the marvellous thing to gaze:</span>
<span class="i0">For lo, the side of Hindfell enwrapped by the fervent blaze,</span>
<span class="i0">And nought 'twixt earth and heaven save a world of flickering flame,</span>
<span class="i0">And a hurrying shifting tangle, where the dark rents went and came.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Great groweth the heart of Sigurd with uttermost desire,</span>
<span class="i0">And he crieth kind to Greyfell, and they hasten up, and nigher,</span>
<span class="i0">Till he draweth rein in the dawning on the face of Hindfell's steep:</span>
<span class="i0">But who shall heed the dawning where the tongues of that wildfire leap?</span>
<span class="i0">For they weave a wavering wall, that driveth over the heaven</span>
<span class="i0">The wind that is born within it; nor ever aside is it driven</span>
<span class="i0">By the mightiest wind of the waste, and the rain-flood amidst it is nought;</span>
<span class="i0">And no wayfarer's door and no window the hand of its builder hath wrought.</span>
<span class="i0">But thereon is the Volsung smiling as its breath uplifteth his hair,</span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes shine bright with its image, and his mail gleams white and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And his war-helm pictures the heavens and the waning stars behind:</span>
<span class="i0">But his neck is Greyfell stretching to snuff at the flame-wall blind,</span>
<span class="i0">And his cloudy flank upheaveth, and tinkleth the knitted mail,</span>
<span class="i0">And the gold of the uttermost waters is waxen wan and pale.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Now Sigurd turns in his saddle, and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts,</span>
<span class="i0">And draws a girth the tighter; then the gathered reins he lifts,</span>
<span class="i0">And crieth aloud to Greyfell, and rides at the wildfire's heart;</span>
<span class="i0">But the white wall wavers before him and the flame-flood rusheth apart,</span>
<span class="i0">And high o'er his head it riseth, and wide and wild is its roar</span>
<span class="i0">As it beareth the mighty tidings to the very heavenly floor:</span>
<span class="i0">But he rideth through its roaring as the warrior rides the rye,</span>
<span class="i0">When it bows with the wind of the summer and the hid spears draw anigh;</span>
<span class="i0">The white flame licks his raiment and sweeps through Greyfell's mane,</span>
<span class="i0">And bathes both hands of Sigurd and the hilts of Fafnir's bane,</span>
<span class="i0">And winds about his war-helm and mingles with his hair,</span>
<span class="i0">But nought his raiment dusketh or dims his glittering gear;</span>
<span class="i0">Then it fails and fades and darkens till all seems left behind,</span>
<span class="i0">And dawn and the blaze is swallowed in mid-mirk stark and blind.</span>

<span class="i0">Beneath a glimmering twilight, and he turns his conquering eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And a ring of pale slaked ashes on the side of Hindfell lies;</span>
<span class="i0">And the world of the waste is beyond it; and all is hushed and grey,</span>
<span class="i0">And the new-risen moon is a-paleing, and the stars grow faint with day.</span>
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked before him and a Shield-burg there he saw,</span>
<span class="i0">A wall of the tiles of Odin wrought clear without a flaw,</span>
<span class="i0">The gold by the silver gleaming, and the ruddy by the white;</span>
<span class="i0">And the blazonings of their glory were done upon them bright,</span>
<span class="i0">As of dear things wrought for the war-lords new come to Odin's hall.</span>
<span class="i0">Piled high aloft to the heavens uprose that battle-wall,</span>
<span class="i0">And far o'er the topmost shield-rim for a banner of fame there hung</span>
<span class="i0">A glorious golden buckler; and against the staff it rung</span>
<span class="i0">As the earliest wind of dawning uprose on Hindfell's face</span>
<span class="i0">And the light from the yellowing east beamed soft on the shielded place.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But the Wrath cried out in answer as Sigurd leapt adown</span>
<span class="i0">To the wasted soil of the desert by that rampart of renown;</span>
<span class="i0">He looked but little beneath it, and the dwelling of God it seemed,</span>
<span class="i0">As against its gleaming silence the eager Sigurd gleamed:</span>
<span class="i0">He draweth not sword from scabbard, as the wall he wendeth around,</span>
<span class="i0">And it is but the wind and Sigurd that wakeneth any sound:</span>
<span class="i0">But, lo, to the gate he cometh, and the doors are open wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And no warder the way withstandeth, and no earls by the threshold abide;</span>
<span class="i0">So he stands awhile and marvels; then the baleful light of the Wrath</span>
<span class="i0">Gleams bare in his ready hand as he wendeth the inward path:</span>
<span class="i0">For he doubteth some guile of the Gods, or perchance some Dwarf-king's snare,</span>
<span class="i0">Or a mock of the Giant people that shall fade in the morning air:</span>
<span class="i0">But he getteth him in and gazeth; and a wall doth he behold,</span>
<span class="i0">And the ruddy set by the white, and the silver by the gold;</span>
<span class="i0">But within the garth that it girdeth no work of man is set,</span>
<span class="i0">But the utmost head of Hindfell ariseth higher yet;</span>
<span class="i0">And below in the very midmost is a Giant-fashioned mound,</span>
<span class="i0">Piled high as the rims of the Shield-burg above the level ground;</span>
<span class="i0">And there, on that mound of the Giants, o'er the wilderness forlorn,</span>
<span class="i0">A pale grey image lieth, and gleameth in the morn.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So there was Sigurd alone; and he went from the shielded door,</span>
<span class="i0">And aloft in the desert of wonder the Light of the Branstock he bore;</span>
<span class="i0">And he set his face to the earth-mound, and beheld the image wan,</span>
<span class="i0">And the dawn was growing about it; and, lo, the shape of a man</span>
<span class="i0">Set forth to the eyeless desert on the tower-top of the world,</span>
<span class="i0">High over the cloud-wrought castle whence the windy bolts are hurled.</span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now he comes to the mound and climbs it, and will see if the man be dead;</span>
<span class="i0">Some King of the days forgotten laid there with crown&egrave;d head,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the frame of a God, it may be, that in heaven hath changed his life,</span>
<span class="i0">Or some glorious heart belov&egrave;d, God-rapt from the earthly strife:</span>
<span class="i0">Now over the body he standeth, and seeth it shapen fair,</span>
<span class="i0">And clad from head to foot-sole in pale grey-glittering gear,</span>
<span class="i0">In a hauberk wrought as straitly as though to the flesh it were grown:</span>
<span class="i0">But a great helm hideth the head and is girt with a glittering crown.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So thereby he stoopeth and kneeleth, for he deems it were good indeed</span>
<span class="i0">If the breath of life abide there and the speech to help at need;</span>
<span class="i0">And as sweet as the summer wind from a garden under the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Cometh forth on the topmost Hindfell the breath of that sleeping-one.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he saith he will look on the face, if it bear him love or hate,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the bonds for his life's constraining, or the sundering doom of fate.</span>
<span class="i0">So he draweth the helm from the head, and, lo, the brow snow-white,</span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth unfurrowed cheeks, and the wise lips breathing light;</span>
<span class="i0">And the face of a woman it is, and the fairest that ever was born,</span>
<span class="i0">Shown forth to the empty heavens and the desert world forlorn:</span>
<span class="i0">But he looketh, and loveth her sore, and he longeth her spirit to move,</span>
<span class="i0">And awaken her heart to the world, that she may behold him and love.</span>
<span class="i0">And he toucheth her breast and her hands, and he loveth her passing sore;</span>
<span class="i0">And he saith: "Awake! I am Sigurd;" but she moveth never the more.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then he looked on his bare bright blade, and he said: "Thou&mdash;what wilt thou do?</span>
<span class="i0">For indeed as I came by the war-garth thy voice of desire I knew."</span>
<span class="i0">Bright burnt the pale blue edges for the sunrise drew anear,</span>
<span class="i0">And the rims of the Shield-burg glittered, and the east was exceeding clear:</span>
<span class="i0">So the eager edges he setteth to the Dwarf-wrought battle-coat</span>
<span class="i0">Where the hammered ring-knit collar constraineth the woman's throat;</span>
<span class="i0">But the sharp Wrath biteth and rendeth, and before it fail the rings,</span>
<span class="i0">And, lo, the gleam of the linen, and the light of golden things:</span>
<span class="i0">Then he driveth the blue steel onward, and through the skirt, and out,</span>
<span class="i0">Till nought but the rippling linen is wrapping her about;</span>
<span class="i0">Then he deems her breath comes quicker and her breast begins to heave,</span>
<span class="i0">So he turns about the War-Flame and rends down either sleeve,</span>
<span class="i0">Till her arms lie white in her raiment, and a river of sun-bright hair</span>
<span class="i0">Flows free o'er bosom and shoulder and floods the desert bare.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then a flush cometh over her visage and a sigh upheaveth her breast,</span>
<span class="i0">And her eyelids quiver and open, and she wakeneth into rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Wide-eyed on the dawning she gazeth, too glad to change or smile,</span>
<span class="i0">And but little moveth her body, nor speaketh she yet for a while;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet kneels Sigurd moveless her wakening speech to heed,</span>
<span class="i0">While soft the waves of the daylight o'er the starless heavens speed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the gleaming rims of the Shield-burg yet bright and brighter grow,</span>
<span class="i0">And the thin moon hangeth her horns dead-white in the golden glow.</span>
<span class="i0">Then she turned and gazed on Sigurd, and her eyes met the Volsung's eyes.</span>
<span class="i0">And mighty and measureless now did the tide of his love arise,</span>
<span class="i0">For their longing had met and mingled, and he knew of her heart that she loved,</span>
<span class="i0">As she spake unto nothing but him and her lips with the speech-flood moved:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"O, what is the thing so mighty that my weary sleep hath torn,</span>
<span class="i0">And rent the fallow bondage, and the wan woe over-worn?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">He said: "The hand of Sigurd and the Sword of Sigmund's son,</span>
<span class="i0">And the heart that the Volsungs fashioned this deed for thee have done."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But she said: "Where then is Odin that laid me here alow?</span>
<span class="i0">Long lasteth the grief of the world, and man-folk's tangled woe!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"He dwelleth above," said Sigurd, "but I on the earth abide,</span>
<span class="i0">And I came from the Glittering Heath the waves of thy fire to ride."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">But therewith the sun rose upward and lightened all the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And the light flashed up to the heavens from the rims of the glorious girth;</span>
<span class="i0">But they twain arose together, and with both her palms outspread,</span>
<span class="i0">And bathed in the light returning, she cried aloud and said:</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"All hail O Day and thy Sons, and thy kin of the coloured things!</span>
<span class="i0">Hail, following Night, and thy Daughter that leadeth thy wavering wings!</span>
<span class="i0">Look down with unangry eyes on us to-day alive,</span>
<span class="i0">And give us the hearts victorious, and the gain for which we strive!</span>
<span class="i0">All hail, ye Lords of God-home, and ye Queens of the House of Gold!</span>
<span class="i0">Hail thou dear Earth that bearest, and thou Wealth of field and fold!</span>
<span class="i0">Give us, your noble children, the glory of wisdom and speech,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts and the hands of healing, and the mouths and hands that teach!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then they turned and were knit together; and oft and o'er again</span>
<span class="i0">They craved, and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looketh upon her, and the words from his heart arise:</span>
<span class="i0">"Thou art the fairest of earth, and the wisest of the wise;</span>
<span class="i0">O who art thou that lovest? I am Sigurd, e'en as I told;</span>
<span class="i0">I have slain the Foe of the Gods, and gotten the Ancient Gold;</span>
<span class="i0">And great were the gain of thy love, and the gift of mine earthly days,</span>
<span class="i0">If we twain should never sunder as we wend on the changing ways.</span>
<span class="i0">O who art thou that lovest, thou fairest of all things born?</span>
<span class="i0">And what meaneth thy sleep and thy slumber in the wilderness forlorn?"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">She said: "I am she that loveth: I was born of the earthly folk,</span>
<span class="i0">But of old Allfather took me from the Kings and their wedding yoke:</span>
<span class="i0">And he called me the Victory-Wafter, and I went and came as he would,</span>
<span class="i0">And I chose the slain for his war-host, and the days were glorious and good,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the thoughts of my heart overcame me, and the pride of my wisdom and speech,</span>
<span class="i0">And I scorned the earth-folk's Framer and the Lord of the world I must teach:</span>
<span class="i0">For the death-doomed I caught from the sword, and the fated life I slew,</span>
<span class="i0">And I deemed that my deeds were goodly, and that long I should do and undo.</span>
<span class="i0">But Allfather came against me and the God in his wrath arose;</span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: 'Thou hast thought in thy folly that the Gods have friends and foes,</span>
<span class="i0">That they wake, and the world wends onward, that they sleep, and the world slips back,</span>
<span class="i0">That they laugh, and the world's weal waxeth, that they frown and fashion the wrack:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast cast up the curse against me; it shall fall aback on thine head;</span>
<span class="i0">Go back to the sons of repentance, with the children of sorrow wed!</span>
<span class="i0">For the Gods are great unholpen, and their grief is seldom seen,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wrong that they will and must be is soon as it hath not been.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Yet I thought: 'Shall I wed in the world, shall I gather grief on the earth?</span>
<span class="i0">Then the fearless heart shall I wed, and bring the best to birth,</span>
<span class="i0">And fashion such tales for the telling, that Earth shall be holpen at least,</span>
<span class="i0">If the Gods think scorn of its fairness, as they sit at the changeless feast.'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Then somewhat smiled Allfather; and he spake: 'So let it be!</span>
<span class="i0">The doom thereof abideth; the doom of me and thee.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet long shall the time pass over ere thy waking-day be born:</span>
<span class="i0">Fare forth, and forget and be weary 'neath the Sting of the Sleepful Thorn!'</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"So I came to the head of Hindfell and the ruddy shields and white,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wall of the wildfire wavering around the isle of night;</span>
<span class="i0">And there the Sleep-thorn pierced me, and the slumber on me fell,</span>
<span class="i0">And the night of nameless sorrows that hath no tale to tell.</span>
<span class="i0">Now I am she that loveth; and the day is nigh at hand</span>
<span class="i0">When I, who have ridden the sea-realm and the regions of the land,</span>
<span class="i0">And dwelt in the measureless mountains and the forge of stormy days,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall dwell in the house of my fathers and the land of the people's praise;</span>
<span class="i0">And there shall hand meet hand, and heart by heart shall beat,</span>
<span class="i0">And the lying-down shall be joyous, and the morn's uprising sweet.</span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, I look on thine heart and behold of thine inmost will,</span>
<span class="i0">That thou of the days wouldst hearken that our portion shall fulfill;</span>
<span class="i0">But O, be wise of man-folk, and the hope of thine heart refrain!</span>
<span class="i0">As oft in the battle's beginning ye vex the steed with the rein,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest at last in its latter ending, when the sword hath hushed the horn,</span>
<span class="i0">His limbs should be weary and fail, and his might be over-worn.</span>
<span class="i0">O be wise, lest thy love constrain me, and my vision wax o'er-clear,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou ask of the thing that thou shouldst not, and the thing that thou wouldst not hear.</span>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Know thou, most mighty of men, that the Norns shall order all,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet without thine helping shall no whit of their will befall;</span>
<span class="i0">Be wise! 'tis a marvel of words, and a mock for the fool and the blind;</span>
<span class="i0">But I saw it writ in the heavens, and its fashioning there did I find:</span>
<span class="i0">And the night of the Norns and their slumber, and the tide when the world runs back,</span>
<span class="i0">And the way of the sun is tangled, it is wrought of the dastard's lack.</span>
<span class="i0">But the day when the fair earth blossoms, and the sun is bright above,</span>
<span class="i0">Of the daring deeds is it fashioned and the eager hearts of love.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Be wise, and cherish thine hope in the freshness of the days,</span>
<span class="i0">And scatter its seed from thine hand in the field of the people's praise;</span>
<span class="i0">Then fair shall it fall in the furrow, and some the earth shall speed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sons of men shall marvel at the blossom of the deed:</span>
<span class="i0">But some the earth shall speed not; nay rather, the wind of the heaven</span>
<span class="i0">Shall waft it away from thy longing&mdash;and a gift to the Gods hast thou given,</span>
<span class="i0">And a tree for the roof and the wall in the house of the hope that shall be,</span>
<span class="i0">Though it seemeth our very sorrow, and the grief of thee and me.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Strive not with the fools of man-folk: for belike thou shalt overcome;</span>
<span class="i0">And what then is the gain of thine hunting when thou bearest the quarry home?</span>
<span class="i0">Or else shall the fool overcome thee, and what deed thereof shall grow?</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, strive with the wise man rather, and increase thy woe and his woe;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet thereof a gain hast thou gotten; and the half of thine heart hast thou won</span>
<span class="i0">If thou mayst prevail against him, and his deeds are the deeds thou hast done:</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and if thou fall before him, in him shalt thou live again,</span>
<span class="i0">And thy deeds in his hand shall blossom, and his heart of thine heart shall be fain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"When thou hearest the fool rejoicing, and he saith, 'It is over and past,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wrong was better than right, and hate turns into love at the last,</span>
<span class="i0">And we strove for nothing at all, and the Gods are fallen asleep;</span>
<span class="i0">For so good is the world a growing that the evil good shall reap:'</span>
<span class="i0">Then loosen thy sword in the scabbard and settle the helm on thine head,</span>
<span class="i0">For men betrayed are mighty, and great are the wrongfully dead.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou do the deed and repent it? thou hadst better never been born:</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou do the deed and exalt it? then thy fame shall be outworn:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt do the deed and abide it, and sit on thy throne on high,</span>
<span class="i0">And look on to-day and to-morrow as those that never die.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"Love thou the Gods&mdash;and withstand them, lest thy fame should fail in the end,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou be but their thrall and their bondsman, who wert born for their very friend:</span>
<span class="i0">For few things from the Gods are hidden, and the hearts of men they know,</span>
<span class="i0">And how that none rejoiceth to quail and crouch alow.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I have spoken the words, belov&egrave;d, to thy matchless glory and worth;</span>
<span class="i0">But thy heart to my heart hath been speaking, though my tongue hath set it forth:</span>
<span class="i0">For I am she that loveth, and I know what thou wouldst teach</span>
<span class="i0">From the heart of thine unlearned wisdom, and I needs must speak thy speech."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then words were weary and silent, but oft and o'er again</span>
<span class="i0">They craved and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the Son of Sigmund: "Fairest, and most of worth,</span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou seen the ways of man-folk and the regions of the earth?</span>
<span class="i0">Then speak yet more of wisdom; for most meet meseems it is</span>
<span class="i0">That my soul to thy soul be shapen, and that I should know thy bliss."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So she took his right hand meekly, nor any word would say,</span>
<span class="i0">Not e'en of love or praising, his longing to delay;</span>
<span class="i0">And they sat on the side of Hindfell, and their fain eyes looked and loved,</span>
<span class="i0">As she told of the hidden matters whereby the world is moved:</span>
<span class="i0">And she told of the framing of all things, and the houses of the heaven;</span>
<span class="i0">And she told of the star-worlds' courses, and how the winds be driven;</span>
<span class="i0">And she told of the Norns and their names, and the fate that abideth the earth;</span>
<span class="i0">And she told of the ways of King-folk in their anger and their mirth;</span>
<span class="i0">And she spake of the love of women, and told of the flame that burns,</span>
<span class="i0">And the fall of mighty houses, and the friend that falters and turns,</span>
<span class="i0">And the lurking blinded vengeance, and the wrong that amendeth wrong,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hand that repenteth its stroke, and the grief that endureth for long;</span>
<span class="i0">And how man shall bear and forbear, and be master of all that is;</span>
<span class="i0">And how man shall measure it all, the wrath, and the grief, and the bliss.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I saw the body of Wisdom, and of shifting guise was she wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">And I stretched out my hands to hold her, and a mote of the dust they caught;</span>
<span class="i0">And I prayed her to come for my teaching, and she came in the midnight dream&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And I woke and might not remember, nor betwixt her tangle deem:</span>
<span class="i0">She spake, and how might I hearken; I heard, and how might I know;</span>
<span class="i0">I knew, and how might I fashion, or her hidden glory show?</span>
<span class="i0">All things I have told thee of Wisdom are but fleeting images</span>
<span class="i0">Of her hosts that abide in the Heavens, and her light that Allfather sees:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet wise is the sower that sows, and wise is the reaper that reaps,</span>
<span class="i0">And wise is the smith in his smiting, and wise is the warder that keeps:</span>
<span class="i0">And wise shalt thou be to deliver, and I shall be wise to desire;</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;And lo, the tale that is told, and the sword and the wakening fire!</span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, I am she that loveth, and hark how Greyfell neighs,</span>
<span class="i0">And Fafnir's Bed is gleaming, and green go the downward ways.</span>
<span class="i0">The road to the children of men and the deeds that thou shalt do</span>
<span class="i0">In the joy of thy life-days' morning, when thine hope is fashioned anew.</span>
<span class="i0">Come now, O Bane of the Serpent, for now is the high-noon come,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sun hangeth over Hindfell and looks on the earth-folk's home;</span>
<span class="i0">But the soul is so great within thee, and so glorious are thine eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">And me so love constraineth, and mine heart that was called the wise,</span>
<span class="i0">That we twain may see men's dwellings and the house where we shall dwell,</span>
<span class="i0">And the place of our life's beginning, where the tale shall be to tell."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So they climb the burg of Hindfell, and hand in hand they fare,</span>
<span class="i0">Till all about and above them is nought but the sunlit air,</span>
<span class="i0">And there close they cling together rejoicing in their mirth;</span>
<span class="i0">For far away beneath them lie the kingdoms of the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And the garths of men-folk's dwellings and the streams that water them,</span>
<span class="i0">And the rich and plenteous acres, and the silver ocean's hem,</span>
<span class="i0">And the woodland wastes and the mountains, and all that holdeth all;</span>
<span class="i0">The house and the ship and the island, the loom and the mine and the stall,</span>
<span class="i0">The beds of bane and healing, the crafts that slay and save,</span>
<span class="i0">The temple of God and the Doom-ring, the cradle and the grave.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then spake the Victory-Wafter: "O King of the Earthly Age,</span>
<span class="i0">As a God thou beholdest the treasure and the joy of thine heritage,</span>
<span class="i0">And where on the wings of his hope is the spirit of Sigurd borne?</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I bid thee hover awhile as a lark alow on the corn;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I bid thee look on the land 'twixt the wood and the silver sea</span>
<span class="i0">In the bight of the swirling river, and the house that cherished me!</span>
<span class="i0">There dwelleth mine earthly sister and the king that she hath wed;</span>
<span class="i0">There morn by morn aforetime I woke on the golden bed;</span>
<span class="i0">There eve by eve I tarried mid the speech and the lays of kings;</span>
<span class="i0">There noon by noon I wandered and plucked the blossoming things;</span>
<span class="i0">The little land of Lymdale by the swirling river's side,</span>
<span class="i0">Where Brynhild once was I called in the days ere my father died;</span>
<span class="i0">The little land of Lymdale 'twixt the woodland and the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Where on thee mine eyes shall brighten and thine eyes shall beam on me."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I shall seek thee there," said Sigurd, "when the day-spring is begun,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere we wend the world together in the season of the sun."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">"I shall bide thee there," said Brynhild, "till the fullness of the days,</span>
<span class="i0">And the time for the glory appointed, and the springing-tide of praise."</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">From his hand then draweth Sigurd Andvari's ancient Gold;</span>
<span class="i0">There is nought but the sky above them as the ring together they hold,</span>
<span class="i0">The shapen ancient token, that hath no change nor end,</span>
<span class="i0">No change, and no beginning, no flaw for God to mend:</span>
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd cries: "O Brynhild, now hearken while I swear,</span>
<span class="i0">That the sun shall die in the heavens and the day no more be fair,</span>
<span class="i0">If I seek not love in Lymdale and the house that fostered thee,</span>
<span class="i0">And the land where thou awakedst 'twixt the woodland and the sea!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">And she cried: "O Sigurd, Sigurd, now hearken while I swear</span>
<span class="i0">That the day shall die for ever and the sun to blackness wear,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere I forget thee, Sigurd, as I lie 'twixt wood and sea</span>
<span class="i0">In the little land of Lymdale and the house that fostered me!"</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">Then he set the ring on her finger and once, if ne'er again,</span>
<span class="i0">They kissed and clung together, and their hearts were full and fain.</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="i0">So the day grew old about them and the joy of their desire,</span>
<span class="i0">And eve and the sunset came, and faint grew the sunset fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And the shadowless death of the day was sweet in the golden tide;</span>
<span class="i0">But the stars shone forth on the world, and the twilight changed and died;</span>
<span class="i0">And sure if the first of man-folk had been born to that starry night,</span>
<span class="i0">And had heard no tale of the sunrise, he had never longed for the light:</span>
<span class="i0">But Earth longed amidst her slumber, as 'neath the night she lay,</span>
<span class="i0">And fresh and all abundant abode the deeds of Day.</span>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
